    <h1 id="s:intro">Introduction</h1>

    <p>Here's the dream:</p>

    <blockquote>
      Computers have revolutionized research, and that revolution is only beginning.
      Every day,
      scientists and engineers all over the world use them
      to study things that are too big, too small, too fast, too slow, too expensive, too dangerous,
      or just too hard to study any other way.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Now here's the reality:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Every day,
      scientists and engineers all over the world waste time wrestling with computers.
      Tasks that should take a few moments take hours or days,
      and many things never work at all.
      And even when things <em>do</em> work,
      most scientists have no idea how reliable their results are.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Most of the pain that researchers feel stems from not knowing
      how to develop software systematically,
      how to tell if their programs are working correctly,
      how to share their work with others
      (except by mailing files to one another),
      or how to keep track of what they've done.
      This sorry state of affairs persists for four reasons:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        No room, no time.
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Everybody's curriculum is full&mdash;there's simply not space to add more about computing
        without dropping something else.
        Or as a scientist once asked me,
        "What should we cut from our physics degree to make room for this stuff:
        thermodynamics or quantum mechanics?"
        (And taking five minutes out of each lecture to talk about computing doesn't work:
        that still adds up to four courses over a four-year degree,
        and anyway,
        it'll be the first thing cut when the lecturer is running late.)
      </dd>

      <dt>
        No standards.
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Reviewers and granting agencies don't expect computational work
        to meet the same standards as other experimental work,
        much less require it to,
        so there's no incentive for scientists to learn how to do so.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        The blind leading the blind.
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Senior researchers can't teach the next generation how to do things
        that they don't know how to do themselves.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        The cult of big iron.
      </dt>
      <dd>
        While most scientists and engineers work on desktop-scale machines,
        most attention and money goes to supercomputers
        that senators and university presidents can stand beside on opening day.
        As a result,
        basic skills are neglected,
        just as nurses' salaries and basic public health initiatives are often sacrificed
        to fund the construction of a new wing at the hospital.
      </dd>

    </dl>

    <p>
      Our goal is to break this vicious cycle by showing scientists and engineers
      how to do more in less time and with less pain.
      To do this,
      we combine half a dozen tools with
      an equal number of working practices
      borrowed from open source software developers.
      Both can be learned in under thirty hours;
      together,
      they can save most researchers up to a day a week
      for the rest of their careers,
      and make whole new areas of research feasible.
    </p>

    <p>
      More specifically,
      we address these questions:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        How can I manage this data?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can I process it?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can I tell if I've processed it correctly?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can I find and fix bugs when I haven't?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can I keep track of what I've done?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can I find and use other people's work?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can other people find and use mine?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can I do all these things faster?
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Our answers come in several parts:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Ever overwritten the wrong file? Use version control.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ever spent ages repeating a sequence of key strokes, then mistyped or lost count and had to start again?
        Write a script!
      </li>
      <li>
        Ever spent ages debugging a complex script you had written?
        Break it into functions that can be built, understood, and fixed independently.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="s:unix">The Unix Shell</h1>

    <p>Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist,
      has just returned from a six-month survey of the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre">North Pacific Gyre</a>,
      where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a>.
      She has 1520 samples in all, and now needs to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Run each sample through an assay machine
        that will measure the relative abundance of 300 different proteins.
        The machine's output for a single sample is
        a file with one line for each protein.</li>
      <li>Calculate statistics for each of the proteins separately
        using a program her supervisor wrote called <code>goostat</code>.</li>
      <li>Compare the statistics for each protein
        with corresponding statistics for each other protein
        using a program one of the other graduate students wrote called <code>goodiff</code>.</li>
      <li>Write up.
        Her supervisor would really like her to do this by the end of the month
        so that her paper can appear in an upcoming special issue of <em>Aquatic Goo Letters</em>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>It takes about half an hour for the assay machine to process each sample.
      The good news is,
      it only takes two minutes to set each one up.
      Since her lab has eight assay machines that she can use in parallel,
      this step will "only" take about two weeks.</p>

    <p>The bad news is that if she has to run <code>goostat</code> and <code>goodiff</code> by hand,
      she'll have to enter filenames and click "OK" roughly 300<sup>2</sup> times
      (300 runs of <code>goostat</code>, plus 300&times;299 runs of <code>goodiff</code>).
      At 30 seconds each,
      that will take 18 weeks.
      Not only would she miss her paper deadline,
      the chances of her getting all 90,000 commands right are approximately zero.</p>

    <p>The next few lessons will explore what she should do instead.
      More specifically,
      they explain how she can use a command shell
      to automate the repetitive steps in her processing pipeline
      so that her computer can work 24 hours a day while she writes her paper.
      As a bonus,
      once she has put a processing pipeline together,
      she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.</p>

    <p>The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive.
      It has survived so long because it's a power tool
      that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes.
      More importantly,
      it helps them combine existing programs in new ways
      and automate repetitive tasks
      so that they don't have to type the same things over and over again.</p>

    <h2>Introducing the Shell</h2>

    <div class="objectives">
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.</li>
        <li>Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>At a high level, computers do four things:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>run programs;</li>
      <li>store data;</li>
      <li>communicate with each other; and</li>
      <li>interact with us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>They can do the last of these in many different ways,
      including direct brain-computer links and speech interfaces.
      Since these are still in their infancy,
      most of us use windows, icons, mice, and pointers.
      These technologies didn't become widespread until the 1980s,
      but their roots go back to Doug Engelbart's work in the 1960s,
      which you can see in what has been called
      <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8734787622017763097#">The Mother of All Demos</a>.</p>

    <p>Going back even further,
      the only way to interact with early computers was to rewire them.
      But in between,
      from the 1950s to the 1980s,
      most people used line printers.
      These devices only allowed input and output of the letters, numbers, and punctuation found on a standard keyboard,
      so programming languages and interfaces had to be designed around that constraint.</p>

    <p>This kind of interface is called a
      <a href="#gloss:cli">command-line interface</a>, or CLI,
      to distinguish it from the
      <a href="#gloss:gui">graphical user interface</a>, or GUI,
      that most people now use.
      The heart of a CLI is a <a href="#gloss:repl">read-evaluate-print loop</a>, or REPL:
      when the user types a command and then presses the enter (or return) key,
      the computer reads it,
      executes it,
      and prints its output.
      The user then types another command,
      and so on until the user logs off.</p>

    <p>This description makes it sound as though the user sends commands directly to the computer,
      and the computer sends output directly to the user.
      In fact,
      there is usually a program in between called a
      <a href="#gloss:shell">command shell</a>.
      What the user types goes into the shell;
      it figures out what commands to run and orders the computer to execute them.</p>

    <p>A shell is a program like any other.
      What's special about it is that its job is to run other programs
      rather than to do calculations itself.
      The most popular Unix shell is Bash,
      the Bourne Again SHell
      (so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne&mdash;this
      is what passes for wit among programmers).
      Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix,
      and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.</p>

    <p>Using Bash or any other shell
      sometimes feels more like programming than like using a mouse.
      Commands are terse (often only a couple of characters long),
      their names are frequently cryptic,
      and their output is lines of text rather than something visual like a graph.
      On the other hand,
      the shell allows us to combine existing tools in powerful ways with only a few keystrokes.
      and to set up pipelines to handle large volumes of data automatically.
      In addition,
      the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines.
      As clusters and cloud computing become more popular for scientific data crunching,
      being able to drive them is becoming a necessary skill.</p>

    <div class="keypoints">
      <h3>Key Points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.</li>
        <li>The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio,
          its support for automating repetitive tasks,
          and that it can be used to access networked machines.</li>
        <li>The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature
          and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Files and Directories</h2>

    <div class="objectives">
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Explain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory.</li>
        <li>Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.</li>
        <li>Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.</li>
        <li>Explain the steps in the shell's read-run-print cycle.</li>
        <li>Identify the actual command, flags, and filenames in a command-line call.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
      is called the <a href="#gloss:filesystem">file system</a>.
      It organizes our data into files,
      which hold information,
      and directories (also called "folders"),
      which hold files or other directories.</p>

    <p>Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
      To start exploring them,
      let's log in to the computer by typing our user ID and password.
      Most systems will print stars to obscure the password,
      or nothing at all,
      in case some evildoer is shoulder surfing behind us:</p>

<pre>login: <span class="in">vlad</span>
password: <span class="in">********</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Once we have logged in we'll see a <a href="#gloss:prompt">prompt</a>,
      which is how the shell tells us that it's waiting for input.
      This is usually just a dollar sign,
      but which may show extra information such as our user ID or the current time.
      Type the command <code>whoami</code>,
      then press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell.
      The command's output is the ID of the current user,
      i.e.,
      it shows us who the shell thinks we are:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">whoami</span>
<span class="out">vlad</span>
$</pre>

    <p>More specifically, when we type <code>whoami</code> the shell:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>finds a program called <code>whoami</code>,</li>
      <li>runs it,</li>
      <li>waits for it to produce some output (which the shell displays), and</li>
      <li>displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Next,
      let's find out where we are by running a command called <code>pwd</code>
      (which stands for "print working directory").
      At any moment,
      our <a href="#gloss:current-working-directory">current working directory</a>
      is our current default directory,
      i.e.,
      the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in
      unless we explicitly specify something else.
      Here,
      the computer's response is <code>/users/vlad</code>,
      which is Vlad's <a href="#gloss:home-directory">home directory</a>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$</pre>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Alphabet Soup</h3>

      <p>If the command to find out who we are is <code>whoami</code>, the command to find
        out where we are ought to be called <code>whereami</code>, so why is it <code>pwd</code>
        instead? The usual answer is that in the early 1970s, when Unix was
        first being developed, every keystroke counted: the devices of the day
        were slow, and backspacing on a teletype was so painful that cutting the
        number of keystrokes in order to cut the number of typing mistakes was
        actually a win for usability. The reality is that commands were added to
        Unix one by one, without any master plan, by people who were immersed in
        its jargon. The result is as inconsistent as the roolz uv Inglish
        speling, but we're stuck with it now.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>To understand what a "home directory" is,
      let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.
      At the top is the <a href="#gloss:root-directory">root directory</a>
      that holds everything else.
      We refer to it using a slash character <code>/</code> on its own;
      this is the leading slash in <code>/users/vlad</code>.</p>

    <p>Inside that directory are several other directories:
      <code>bin</code> (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
      <code>data</code> (for miscellaneous data files),
      <code>users</code> (where users' personal directories are located),
      <code>tmp</code> (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
      and so on:</p>

    <p><img src="bash/novice/img/filesystem.svg" alt="The Filesystem" /></p>

    <p>We know that our current working directory <code>/users/vlad</code> is stored inside <code>/users</code>
      because <code>/users</code> is the first part of its name.
      Similarly,
      we know that <code>/users</code> is stored inside the root directory <code>/</code>
      because its name begins with <code>/</code>.</p>

    <p>Underneath <code>/users</code>,
      we find one directory for each user with an account on this machine.
      The Mummy's files are stored in <code>/users/imhotep</code>,
      Wolfman's in <code>/users/larry</code>,
      and ours in <code>/users/vlad</code>,
      which is why <code>vlad</code> is the last part of the directory's name.</p>

    <p><img src="bash/novice/img/home-directories.svg" alt="Home Directories" /></p>

    <p>Notice that there are two meanings for the <code>/</code> character.
      When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
      it refers to the root directory. When it appears <em>inside</em> a name,
      it's just a separator.</p>

    <p>Let's see what's in Vlad's home directory by running <code>ls</code>,
      which stands for "listing":</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">bin          data      mail       music
notes.txt    papers    pizza.cfg  solar
solar.pdf    swc</span>
$</pre>

    <p><img src="bash/novice/img/vlad-homedir.svg" alt="Vlad's Home Directory" /></p>

    <p><code>ls</code> prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order,
      arranged neatly into columns.
      We can make its output more comprehensible by using the <a href="#gloss:command-line-flag">flag</a> <code>-F</code>,
      which tells <code>ls</code> to add a trailing <code>/</code> to the names of directories:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Here,
      we can see that <code>/users/vlad</code> contains seven <a href="#gloss:sub-directory">sub-directories</a>.
      The names that don't have trailing slashes,
      like <code>notes.txt</code>, <code>pizza.cfg</code>, and <code>solar.pdf</code>,
      are plain old files.
      And note that there is a space between <code>ls</code> and <code>-F</code>:
      without it,
      the shell thinks we're trying to run a command called <code>ls-F</code>,
      which doesn't exist.</p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>What's In A Name?</h3>

      <p>You may have noticed that all of Vlad's files' names are "something dot
        something". This is just a convention: we can call a file <code>mythesis</code> or
        almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names
        most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds
        of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the
        <a href="#gloss:filename-extension">filename extension</a>, and indicates
        what type of data the file holds: <code>.txt</code> signals a plain text file, <code>.pdf</code>
        indicates a PDF document, <code>.cfg</code> is a configuration file full of parameters
        for some program or other, and so on.</p>

      <p>It's important to remember that this is just a convention. Files contain
        bytes: it's up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes according
        to the rules for PDF documents, images, and so on. For example, naming a
        PNG image of a whale as <code>whale.mp3</code> doesn't somehow magically turn it
        into a recording of whalesong.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Now let's take a look at what's in Vlad's <code>data</code> directory by running the command <code>ls -F data</code>.
      The second parameter&mdash;the one <em>without</em> a leading dash&mdash;tells <code>ls</code> that
      we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -F data</span>
<span class="out">amino-acids.txt   elements/     morse.txt
pdb/              planets.txt   sunspot.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The output shows us that there are four text files and two sub-sub-directories.
      Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:
      it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
      just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
      but it's a self-defeating strategy.</p>

    <p>Notice, by the way that we spelled the directory name <code>data</code>.
      It doesn't have a trailing slash:
      that's added to directory names by <code>ls</code> when we use the <code>-F</code> flag to help us tell things apart.
      And it doesn't begin with a slash because it's a <a href="#gloss:relative-path">relative path</a>,
      i.e., it tells <code>ls</code> how to find something from where we are,
      rather than from the root of the file system.</p>

    <p>If we run <code>ls -F /data</code> (<em>with</em> a leading slash) we get a different answer,
      because <code>/data</code> is an <a href="#gloss:absolute-path">absolute path</a>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -F /data</span>
<span class="out">access.log    backup/    hardware.cfg
network.cfg</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The leading <code>/</code> tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the filesystem,
      so it always refers to exactly one directory,
      no matter where we are when we run the command.</p>

    <p>What if we want to change our current working directory?
      Before we do this,
      <code>pwd</code> shows us that we're in <code>/users/vlad</code>,
      and <code>ls</code> without any parameters shows us that directory's contents:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We can use <code>cd</code> followed by a directory name to change our working directory.
      <code>cd</code> stands for "change directory",
      which is a bit misleading:
      the command doesn't change the directory,
      it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cd data</span>
$</pre>

    <p><code>cd</code> doesn't print anything,
      but if we run <code>pwd</code> after it, we can see that we are now in <code>/users/vlad/data</code>.
      If we run <code>ls</code> without parameters now,
      it lists the contents of <code>/users/vlad/data</code>,
      because that's where we now are:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/data</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">amino-acids.txt   elements/     morse.txt
pdb/              planets.txt   sunspot.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We now know how to go down the directory tree:
      how do we go up?
      We could use an absolute path:</p>

<pre>$ cd /users/vlad
$</pre>

    <p>but it's almost always simpler to use <code>cd ..</code> to go up one level:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/data</span>
$ <span class="in">cd ..</span>
$</pre>

    <p><code>..</code> is a special directory name meaning
      "the directory containing this one",
      or more succinctly,
      the <a href="#gloss:parent-directory">parent</a> of the current directory.
      Sure enough,
      if we run <code>pwd</code> after running <code>cd ..</code>, we're back in <code>/users/vlad</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The special directory <code>..</code> doesn't usually show up when we run <code>ls</code>.
      If we want to display it, we can give <code>ls</code> the <code>-a</code> flag:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -F -a</span>
<span class="out">./           ../       bin/       data/
mail/        music/    notes.txt  papers/
pizza.cfg    solar/    solar.pdf    swc/</span>
$</pre>

    <p><code>-a</code> stands for "show all";
      it forces <code>ls</code> to show us file and directory names that begin with <code>.</code>,
      such as <code>..</code> (which, if we're in <code>/users/vlad</code>, refers to the <code>/users</code> directory).
      As you can see,
      it also displays another special directory that's just called <code>.</code>,
      which means "the current working directory".
      It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
      but we'll see some uses for it soon.</p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Orthogonality</h3>

      <p>The special names <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> don't belong to <code>ls</code>;
        they are interpreted the same way by every program.
        For example,
        if we are in <code>/users/vlad/data</code>,
        the command <code>ls ..</code> will give us a listing of <code>/users/vlad</code>.
        When the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they're combined,
        programmers say they are <a href="#gloss:orthogonal">orthogonal</a>:
        Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn
        because there are fewer special cases and exceptions to keep track of.</p>

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files</h3>

    <p>Knowing just this much about files and directories,
      Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
      First,
      she creates a directory called <code>north-pacific-gyre</code>
      (to remind herself where the data came from).
      Inside that,
      she creates a directory called <code>2012-07-03</code>,
      which is the date she started processing the samples.
      She used to use names like <code>conference-paper</code> and <code>revised-results</code>,
      but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
      (The final straw was when she found herself creating
      a directory called <code>revised-revised-results-3</code>.)</p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Year, Month, Day</h3>

      <p>Nelle names her directories "year-month-day",
        with leading zeroes for months and days,
        because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
        If she used month names,
        December would come before July;
        if she didn't use leading zeroes,
        November ('11') would come before July ('7').</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
      with a unique ten-character ID,
      such as "NENE01729A".
      This is what she used in her collection log
      to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
      so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
      Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
      she will call her files <code>NENE01729A.txt</code>, <code>NENE01812A.txt</code>, and so on.
      All 1520 files will go into the same directory.</p>

    <p>If she is in her home directory,
      Nelle can see what files she has using the command:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/</span></pre>

    <p>This is a lot to type,
      but she can let the shell do most of the work.
      If she types:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls no</span></pre>

    <p>and then presses tab,
      the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls north-pacific-gyre/</span></pre>

    <p>If she presses tab again,
      Bash will add <code>2012-07-03/</code> to the command,
      since it's the only possible completion.
      Pressing tab again does nothing,
      since there are 1520 possibilities;
      pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files,
      and so on.
      This is called <a href="#gloss:tab-completion">tab completion</a>,
      and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.</p>

    <p>We now know how to explore files and directories,
      but how do we create them in the first place?
      Let's go back to Vlad's home directory,
      <code>/users/vlad</code>,
      and use <code>ls -F</code> to see what it contains:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$ <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Let's create a new directory called <code>thesis</code> using the command <code>mkdir thesis</code>
      (which has no output):</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">mkdir thesis</span>
$</pre>

    <p>As you might (or might not) guess from its name,
      <code>mkdir</code> means "make directory".
      Since <code>thesis</code> is a relative path
      (i.e., doesn't have a leading slash),
      the new directory is made below the current working directory:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/      thesis/</span>
$</pre>

    <p>However, there's nothing in it yet:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -F thesis</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Let's change our working directory to <code>thesis</code> using <code>cd</code>,
      then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called <code>draft.txt</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cd thesis</span>
$ <span class="in">nano draft.txt</span></pre>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Which Editor?</h3>

      <p>When we say, "<code>nano</code> is a text editor," we really do mean "text": it can
        only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other
        human-friendly media. We use it in examples because almost anyone can
        drive it anywhere without training, but please use something more
        powerful for real work. On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X),
        many programmers use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or
        <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> (both of which are completely unintuitive,
        even by Unix standards), or a graphical editor such as
        <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">Gedit</a>. On Windows, you may wish to
        use <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.</p>

      <p>No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches
        for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably)
        use your current working directory as its default location. If you use
        your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or
        documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to
        another directory the first time you "Save As..."</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Let's type in a few lines of text,
      then use Control-O to write our data to disk:</p>

    <p><img src="bash/novice/img/nano-screenshot.png" alt="Nano in Action" /></p>

    <p>Once our file is saved,
      we can use Control-X to quit the editor and return to the shell.
      <code>nano</code> doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
      but <code>ls</code> now shows that we have created a file called <code>draft.txt</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">draft.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We can run <code>ls</code> with the <code>-s</code> flag (for "size")
      to show us how large <code>draft.txt</code> is:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -s</span>
<span class="out">   1  draft.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Unfortunately,
      Unix reports sizes in <a href="#gloss:disk-block">disk blocks</a> by default,
      which might be the least helpful default possible.
      If we add the <code>-h</code> flag,
      <code>ls</code> switches to more human-friendly units:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -s -h</span>
<span class="out"> 512  draft.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Here, 512 is the number of bytes in the file.
      This is more than we actually typed in because the smallest unit of storage on the disk
      is typically a block of 512 bytes.</p>

    <p>Let's tidy up by running <code>rm draft.txt</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">rm draft.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>This command removes files ("rm" is short for "remove").
      If we run <code>ls</code> again,
      its output is empty once more,
      which tells us that our file is gone:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls</span>
$</pre>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Deleting Is Forever</h3>

      <p>Unix doesn't have a trash bin: when we delete files, they are unhooked
        from the file system so that their storage space on disk can be
        recycled. Tools for finding and recovering deleted files do exist, but
        there's no guarantee they'll work in any particular situation, since the
        computer may recycle the file's disk space right away.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Let's re-create that file
      and then move up one directory to <code>/users/vlad</code> using <code>cd ..</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/thesis</span>
$ <span class="in">nano draft.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">draft.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">cd ..</span>
$</pre>

    <p>If we try to remove the entire <code>thesis</code> directory using <code>rm thesis</code>,
      we get an error message:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">rm thesis</span>
<span class="err">rm: cannot remove 'thesis': Is a directory</span>
$</pre>

    <p>This happens because <code>rm</code> only works on files, not directories.
      The right command is <code>rmdir</code>,
      which is short for "remove directory".
      It doesn't work yet either, though,
      because the directory we're trying to remove isn't empty:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">rmdir thesis</span>
<span class="err">rmdir: failed to remove 'thesis': Directory not empty</span>
$</pre>

    <p>This little safety feature can save you a lot of grief,
      particularly if you are a bad typist.
      To really get rid of <code>thesis</code> we must first delete the file <code>draft.txt</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">rm thesis/draft.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The directory is now empty, so <code>rmdir</code> can delete it:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">rmdir thesis</span>
$</pre>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</h3>

      <p>Removing the files in a directory just so that we can remove the
        directory quickly becomes tedious. Instead, we can use <code>rm</code> with the
        <code>-r</code> flag (which stands for "recursive"):</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">rm -r thesis</span>
$</pre>

      <p>This removes everything in the directory, then the directory itself. If
        the directory contains sub-directories, <code>rm -r</code> does the same thing to
        them, and so on. It's very handy, but can do a lot of damage if used
        without care.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Let's create that directory and file one more time.
      (Note that this time we're running <code>nano</code> with the path <code>thesis/draft.txt</code>,
      rather than going into the <code>thesis</code> directory and running <code>nano</code> on <code>draft.txt</code> there.)</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/thesis</span>
$ <span class="in">mkdir thesis</span>
$ <span class="in">nano thesis/draft.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls thesis</span>
<span class="out">draft.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p><code>draft.txt</code> isn't a particularly informative name,
      so let's change the file's name using <code>mv</code>,
      which is short for "move":</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt</span></pre>

    <p>The first parameter tells <code>mv</code> what we're "moving",
      while the second is where it's to go.
      In this case,
      we're moving <code>thesis/draft.txt</code> to <code>thesis/quotes.txt</code>,
      which has the same effect as renaming the file.
      Sure enough,
      <code>ls</code> shows us that <code>thesis</code> now contains one file called <code>quotes.txt</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls thesis</span>
<span class="out">quotes.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Just for the sake of inconsistency,
      <code>mv</code> also works on directories&mdash;there is no separate <code>mvdir</code> command.</p>

    <p>Let's move <code>quotes.txt</code> into the current working directory.
      We use <code>mv</code> once again,
      but this time we'll just use the name of a directory as the second parameter
      to tell <code>mv</code> that we want to keep the filename,
      but put the file somewhere new.
      (This is why the command is called "move".)
      In this case,
      the directory name we use is the special directory name <code>.</code> that we mentioned earlier.</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">mv thesis/quotes.txt .</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
      <code>ls</code> now shows us that <code>thesis</code> is empty:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls thesis</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Further,
      <code>ls</code> with a filename or directory name as an parameter only lists that file or directory.
      We can use this to see that <code>quotes.txt</code> is still in our current directory:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls quotes.txt</span>
<span class="out">quotes.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The <code>cp</code> command works very much like <code>mv</code>,
      except it copies a file instead of moving it.
      We can check that it did the right thing using <code>ls</code>
      with two paths as parameters&mdash;like most Unix commands,
      <code>ls</code> can be given thousands of paths at once:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt</span>
<span class="out">quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>To prove that we made a copy,
      let's delete the <code>quotes.txt</code> file in the current directory
      and then run that same <code>ls</code> again.
      This time it tells us that it can't find <code>quotes.txt</code> in the current directory,
      but it does find the copy in <code>thesis</code> that we didn't delete:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt</span>
<span class="err">ls: cannot access quotes.txt: No such file or directory</span>
<span class="out">thesis/quotations.txt</span>
$</pre>

      <h3>Another Useful Abbreviation</h3>

    <p>Now that we know a few basic commands,
      we can finally look at the shell's most powerful feature:
      the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways.
      We'll start with a directory called <code>molecules</code>
      that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules.
      The <code>.pdb</code> extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format,
      a simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in the molecule.</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls molecules</span>
<span class="out">cubane.pdb    ethane.pdb    methane.pdb
octane.pdb    pentane.pdb   propane.pdb</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Let's go into that directory with <code>cd</code> and run the command <code>wc *.pdb</code>.
      <code>wc</code> is the "word count" command:
      it counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files.
      The <code>*</code> in <code>*.pdb</code> matches zero or more characters,
      so the shell turns <code>*.pdb</code> into a complete list of <code>.pdb</code> files:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cd molecules</span>
$ <span class="in">wc *.pdb</span>
<span class="out">  20  156 1158 cubane.pdb
  12   84  622 ethane.pdb
   9   57  422 methane.pdb
  30  246 1828 octane.pdb
  21  165 1226 pentane.pdb
  15  111  825 propane.pdb
 107  819 6081 total</span>
$</pre>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Wildcards</h3>

      <p><code>*</code> is a <a href="#gloss:wildcard">wildcard</a>. It matches zero or more
        characters, so <code>*.pdb</code> matches <code>ethane.pdb</code>, <code>propane.pdb</code>, and so on.
        On the other hand, <code>p*.pdb</code> only matches <code>pentane.pdb</code> and
        <code>propane.pdb</code>, because the 'p' at the front only matches itself.</p>

      <p><code>?</code> is also a wildcard, but it only matches a single character. This
        means that <code>p?.pdb</code> matches <code>pi.pdb</code> or <code>p5.pdb</code>, but not <code>propane.pdb</code>.
        We can use any number of wildcards at a time: for example, <code>p*.p?*</code>
        matches anything that starts with a 'p' and ends with '.', 'p', and at
        least one more character (since the '?' has to match one character, and
        the final '*' can match any number of characters). Thus, <code>p*.p?*</code> would
        match <code>preferred.practice</code>, and even <code>p.pi</code> (since the first '*' can
        match no characters at all), but not <code>quality.practice</code> (doesn't start
        with 'p') or <code>preferred.p</code> (there isn't at least one character after the
        '.p').</p>

      <p>When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands it to create a list of
        matching filenames <em>before</em> running the command that was asked for.
        This means that commands like <code>wc</code> and <code>ls</code> never see the wildcard
        characters, just what those wildcards matched. This is another example
        of orthogonal design.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If we run <code>wc -l</code> instead of just <code>wc</code>,
      the output shows only the number of lines per file:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">wc -l *.pdb</span>
<span class="out">  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We can also use <code>-w</code> to get only the number of words,
      or <code>-c</code> to get only the number of characters.</p>

    <p>Which of these files is shortest?
      It's an easy question to answer when there are only six files,
      but what if there were 6000?
      Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The <code>&gt;</code> tells the shell to <a href="#gloss:redirect">redirect</a> the command's output
      to a file instead of printing it to the screen.
      The shell will create the file if it doesn't exist,
      or overwrite the contents of that file if it does.
      (This is why there is no screen output:
      everything that <code>wc</code> would have printed has gone into the file <code>lengths</code> instead.)
      <code>ls lengths</code> confirms that the file exists:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls lengths</span>
<span class="out">lengths</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We can now send the content of <code>lengths</code> to the screen using <code>cat lengths</code>.
      <code>cat</code> stands for "concatenate":
      it prints the contents of files one after another.
      There's only one file in this case,
      so <code>cat</code> just shows us what it contains:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cat lengths</span>
<span class="out">  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Now let's use the <code>sort</code> command to sort its contents.
      This does <em>not</em> change the file;
      instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">sort lengths</span>
<span class="out">  9  methane.pdb
 12  ethane.pdb
 15  propane.pdb
 20  cubane.pdb
 21  pentane.pdb
 30  octane.pdb
107  total</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called <code>sorted-lengths</code>
      by putting <code>&gt; sorted-lengths</code> after the command,
      just as we used <code>&gt; lengths</code> to put the output of <code>wc</code> into <code>lengths</code>.
      Once we've done that,
      we can run another command called <code>head</code> to get the first few lines in <code>sorted-lengths</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">sort lengths &gt; sorted-lengths</span>
$ <span class="in">head -1 sorted-lengths</span>
<span class="out">  9  methane.pdb</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Using the parameter <code>-1</code> with <code>head</code> tells it that
      we only want the first line of the file;
      <code>-20</code> would get the first 20,
      and so on.
      Since <code>sorted-lengths</code> contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest,
      the output of <code>head</code> must be the file with the fewest lines.</p>

    <p>If you think this is confusing,
      you're in good company:
      even once you understand what <code>wc</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>head</code> do,
      all those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on.
      We can make it easier to understand by running <code>sort</code> and <code>head</code> together:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">sort lengths | head -1</span>
<span class="out">  9  methane.pdb</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The vertical bar between the two commands is called a <a href="#gloss:pipe">pipe</a>.
      It tells the shell that we want to use
      the output of the command on the left
      as the input to the command on the right.
      The computer might create a temporary file if it needs to,
      or copy data from one program to the other in memory,
      or something else entirely;
      we don't have to know or care.</p>

    <p>We can use another pipe to send the output of <code>wc</code> directly to <code>sort</code>,
      which then sends its output to <code>head</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">wc -l *.pdb | sort | head -1</span>
<span class="out">  9  methane.pdb</span>
$</pre>

    <p>This is exactly like a mathematician nesting functions like <em>sin(&pi;x)<sup>2</sup></em>
      and saying "the square of the sine of <em>x</em> times &pi;".
      In our case,
      the calculation is "head of sort of word count of <code>*.pdb</code>".</p>

    <p>Here's what actually happens behind the scenes when we create a pipe.
      When a computer runs a program&mdash;any program&mdash;it creates a <a href="#gloss:process">process</a>
      in memory to hold the program's software and its current state.
      Every process has an input channel called <a href="#gloss:standard-input">standard input</a>.
      (By this point, you may be surprised that the name is so memorable, but don't worry:
      most Unix programmers call it "stdin".
      Every process also has a default output channel called <a href="#gloss:standard-output">standard output</a>
      (or "stdout").</p>

    <p>The shell is just another program,
      and runs in a process like any other.
      Under normal circumstances,
      whatever we type on the keyboard is sent to the shell on its standard input,
      and whatever it produces on standard output is displayed on our screen.
      When we tell the shell to run a program,
      it creates a new process
      and temporarily sends whatever we type on our keyboard to that process's standard input,
      and whatever the process sends to standard output to the screen.</p>

    <p>Here's what happens when we run <code>wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths</code>.
      The shell starts by telling the computer to create a new process to run the <code>wc</code> program.
      Since we've provided some filenames as parameters,
      <code>wc</code> reads from them instead of from standard input.
      And since we've used <code>&gt;</code> to redirect output to a file,
      the shell connects the process's standard output to that file.</p>

    <p>If we run <code>wc -l *.pdb | sort</code> instead,
      the shell creates two processes
      (one for each process in the pipe)
      so that <code>wc</code> and <code>sort</code> run simultaneously.
      The standard output of <code>wc</code> is fed directly to the standard input of <code>sort</code>;
      since there's no redirection with <code>&gt;</code>,
      <code>sort</code>'s output goes to the screen.
      And if we run <code>wc -l *.pdb | sort | head -1</code>,
      we get three processes with data flowing from the files,
      through <code>wc</code> to <code>sort</code>,
      and from <code>sort</code> through <code>head</code> to the screen.</p>

    <p>This simple idea is why Unix has been so successful.
      Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things,
      Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well,
      and that work well with each other.
      This programming model is called <a href="#gloss:pipe-and-filter">pipes and filters</a>.
      We've already seen pipes;
      a <a href="#gloss:filter">filter</a> is a program that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output.
      Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way:
      unless told to do otherwise,
      they read from standard input,
      do something with what they've read,
      and write to standard output.</p>

    <p>The key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input
      and writes lines of text to standard output
      can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well.
      You can <em>and should</em> write your programs this way
      so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.</p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Redirecting Input</h3>

      <p>As well as using <code>&gt;</code> to redirect a program's output, we can use <code>&lt;</code> to
        redirect its input, i.e., to read from a file instead of from standard
        input. For example, instead of writing <code>wc ammonia.pdb</code>, we could write
        <code>wc &lt; ammonia.pdb</code>. In the first case, <code>wc</code> gets a command line
        parameter telling it what file to open. In the second, <code>wc</code> doesn't have
        any command line parameters, so it reads from standard input, but we
        have told the shell to send the contents of <code>ammonia.pdb</code> to <code>wc</code>'s
        standard input.</p>

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Checking Files</h3>

    <p>Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines
      and created 1520 files in the <code>north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</code> directory described earlier.
      As a quick sanity check, she types:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</span>
$ <span class="out">wc -l *.txt</span>
</pre>

    <p>The output is 1520 lines that look like this:</p>

<pre> <span class="out">300 NENE01729A.txt
 300 NENE01729B.txt
 300 NENE01736A.txt
 300 NENE01751A.txt
 300 NENE01751B.txt
 300 NENE01812A.txt
 ... ...</span>
</pre>

    <p>Now she types this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">wc -l *.txt | sort | head -5</span>
<span class="out"> 240 NENE02018B.txt
 300 NENE01729A.txt
 300 NENE01729B.txt
 300 NENE01736A.txt
 300 NENE01751A.txt</span>
</pre>

    <p>Whoops: one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others.
      When she goes back and checks it,
      she sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning&mdash;someone
      was probably in using the machine on the weekend,
      and she forgot to reset it.
      Before re-running that sample,
      she checks to see if any files have too much data:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">wc -l *.txt | sort | tail -5</span>
<span class="out"> 300 NENE02040A.txt
 300 NENE02040B.txt
 300 NENE02040Z.txt
 300 NENE02043A.txt
 300 NENE02043B.txt</span>
</pre>

    <p>Those numbers look good&mdash;but what's that 'Z' doing there in the third-to-last line?
      All of her samples should be marked 'A' or 'B';
      by convention,
      her lab uses 'Z' to indicate samples with missing information.
      To find others like it, she does this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls *Z.txt</span>
<span class="out">NENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Sure enough,
      when she checks the log on her laptop,
      there's no depth recorded for either of those samples.
      Since it's too late to get the information any other way,
      she must exclude those two files from her analysis.
      She could just delete them using <code>rm</code>,
      but there are actually some analyses she might do later where depth doesn't matter,
      so instead, she'll just be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expression <code>*[AB].txt</code>.
      As always,
      the '*' matches any number of characters;
      the expression <code>[AB]</code> matches either an 'A' or a 'B',
      so this matches all the valid data files she has.</p>

          If we run <code>sort</code> on each of the files shown on the left in the table

          The command <code>uniq</code> removes adjacent duplicated lines from its input.
          For example, if a file <code>salmon.txt</code> contains:

<pre>coho
coho
steelhead
coho
steelhead
steelhead</pre>

          then <code>uniq salmon.txt</code> produces:

<pre>coho
steelhead
coho
steelhead
</pre>

          Why do you think <code>uniq</code> only removes <em>adjacent</em> duplicated lines?
          (Hint: think about very large data sets.) What other command could
          you combine with it in a pipe to remove all duplicated lines?
        </li>
        <li>
          A file called <code>animals.txt</code> contains the following data:

2012-11-06,rabbit

2012-11-06,fox
2012-11-07,rabbit

    <h2>Loops</h2>

    <div class="objectives">
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.</li>
        <li>Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop.</li>
        <li>Explain the difference between a variable's name and its value.</li>

        <li>Re-run recently executed commands without retyping them.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Wildcards and tab completion are two ways to reduce typing (and typing mistakes).
      Another is to tell the shell to do something over and over again.
      Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named <code>basilisk.dat</code>, <code>unicorn.dat</code>, and so on.
      When new files arrive,
      we'd like to rename the existing ones to <code>original-basilisk.dat</code> and <code>original-unicorn.dat</code>.
      We can't use:</p>

<pre class="in">mv *.dat original-*.dat</pre>

    <p>because that would expand (in the two-file case) to:</p>

<pre class="in">mv basilisk.dat unicorn.dat</pre>

    <p>This wouldn't back up our files:
      it would replace the content of <code>unicorn.dat</code> with whatever's in <code>basilisk.dat</code>.</p>

    <p>Instead, we can use a <a href="#gloss:for-loop">loop</a>
      to do some operation once for each thing in a list.
      Here's a simple example that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">for filename in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat</span>
&gt; <span class="in">do</span>
&gt; <span class="in">   head -3 $filename</span>
&gt; <span class="in">done</span>
<span class="out">COMMON NAME: basilisk
CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
UPDATED: 1745-05-02
COMMON NAME: unicorn
CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros
UPDATED: 1738-11-24</span>
$</pre>

    <p>When the shell sees the keyword <code>for</code>,
      it knows it is supposed to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each thing in a list.
      In this case, the list is the two filenames.
      Each time through the loop,
      the name of the thing currently being operated on is assigned to
      the <a href="#gloss:variable">variable</a> called <code>filename</code>.
      Inside the loop,
      we get the variable's value by putting <code>$</code> in front of it:
      <code>$filename</code> is <code>basilisk.dat</code> the first time through the loop,
      <code>unicorn.dat</code> the second,
      and so on.
      Finally,
      the command that's actually being run is our old friend <code>head</code>,
      so this loop prints out the first three lines of each data file in turn.</p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Follow the Prompt</h3>

      <p>The shell prompt changes from <code>$</code> to <code>&gt;</code> and back again as we were
        typing in our loop. The second prompt, <code>&gt;</code>, is different to remind
        us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>We have called the variable in this loop <code>filename</code>
      in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
      The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;
      if we wrote this loop as:</p>

<pre class="in">for x in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -3 $x
done</pre>

    <p>or:</p>

<pre class="in">for temperature in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -3 $temperature
done</pre>

    <p>it would work exactly the same way.
      <em>Don't do this.</em>
      Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
      so using meaningless names (like <code>x</code>) or misleading names (like <code>temperature</code>)
      increases the likelihood of the program being wrong.</p>

    <p>Here's a slightly more complicated loop:</p>

<pre class="in">for filename in *.dat
do
    echo $filename
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done</pre>

    <p>The shell starts by expanding <code>*.dat</code> to create the list of files it will process.
      The <a href="#gloss:loop-body">loop body</a>
      then executes two commands for each of those files.
      The first, <code>echo</code>, just prints its command-line parameters to standard output.
      For example:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">echo hello there</span>
<span class="out">hello there</span>
$</pre>

    <p>In this case,
      since the shell expands <code>$filename</code> to be the name of a file,
      <code>echo $filename</code> just prints the name of the file.
      Note that we can't write this as:</p>

<pre class="in">for filename in *.dat
do
    $filename
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done</pre>

    <p>because then the first time through the loop,
      when <code>$filename</code> expanded to <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
      the shell would try to run <code>basilisk.dat</code> as a program.
      Finally,
      the <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> combination selects lines 81-100 from whatever file is being processed.</p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Spaces in Names</h3>

      <p>Filename expansion in loops is another reason you should not use spaces in filenames.
        Suppose our data files are named:</p>

<pre>basilisk.dat
red dragon.dat
unicorn.dat</pre>

      <p>If we try to process them using:</p>

<pre class="in">for filename in *.dat
do
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done</pre>

      <p>then the shell will expand <code>*.dat</code> to create:</p>

<pre>basilisk.dat red dragon.dat unicorn.dat</pre>

      <p>With older versions of Bash,
        or most other shells,
        <code>filename</code> will then be assigned the following values in turn:</p>

<pre>basilisk.dat
red
dragon.dat
unicorn.dat</pre>

      <p>That's a problem: <code>head</code> can't read files called <code>red</code> and <code>dragon.dat</code>
        because they don't exist,
        and won't be asked to read the file <code>red dragon.dat</code>.</p>

      <p>We can make our script a little bit more robust
        by <a href="#gloss:shell-quoting">quoting</a> our use of the variable:</p>

<pre class="in">for filename in *.dat
do
    head -100 "$filename" | tail -20
done</pre>

      <p>but it's simpler just to avoid using spaces (or other special characters) in filenames.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Going back to our original file renaming problem,
      we can solve it using this loop:</p>

<pre class="in">for filename in *.dat
do
    mv $filename original-$filename
done</pre>

    <p>This loop runs the <code>mv</code> command once for each filename.
      The first time,
      when <code>$filename</code> expands to <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
      the shell executes:</p>

<pre>mv basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat</pre>

    <p>The second time, the command is:</p>

<pre>mv unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat</pre>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Measure Twice, Run Once</h3>

      <p>A loop is a way to do many things at once&mdash;or to make many mistakes at
        once if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop <em>would</em> do
        is to echo the commands it would run instead of actually running them.
        For example, we could write our file renaming loop like this:</p>

<pre class="in">for filename in *.dat
do
    echo mv $filename original-$filename
done</pre>

      <p>Instead of running <code>mv</code>, this loop runs <code>echo</code>, which prints out:</p>

<pre class="out">mv basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
mv unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat</pre>

      <p><em>without</em> actually running those commands. We can then use up-arrow to
        redisplay the loop, back-arrow to get to the word <code>echo</code>, delete it, and
        then press "enter" to run the loop with the actual <code>mv</code> commands. This
        isn't foolproof, but it's a handy way to see what's going to happen when
        you're still learning how loops work.</p>

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Processing Files</h3>

    <p>Nelle is now ready to process her data files.
      Since she's still learning how to use the shell,
      she decides to build up the required commands in stages.
      Her first step is to make sure that she can select the right files&mdash;remember,
      these are ones whose names end in 'A' or 'B', rather than 'Z':</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</span>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt</span>
&gt; <span class="in">do</span>
&gt; <span class="in">    echo $datafile</span>
&gt; <span class="in">done</span>
<span class="out">NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Her next step is to decide
      what to call the files that the <code>goostat</code> analysis program will create.
      Prefixing each input file's name with "stats" seems simple,
      so she modifies her loop to do that:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt</span>
&gt; <span class="in">do</span>
&gt; <span class="in">    echo $datafile stats-$datafile</span>
&gt; <span class="in">done</span>
<span class="out">NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt stats-NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt stats-NENE02043B.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>She hasn't actually run <code>goostats</code> yet,
      but now she's sure she can select the right files and generate the right output filenames.</p>

    <p>Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious,
      though,
      and Nelle is worried about making mistakes,
      so instead of re-entering her loop,
      she presses the up arrow.
      In response,
      the shell redisplays the whole loop on one line
      (using semi-colons to separate the pieces):</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done</span></pre>

    <p>Using the left arrow key,
      Nelle backs up and changes the command <code>echo</code> to <code>goostats</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt; do goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done</span></pre>

    <p>When she presses enter,
      the shell runs the modified command.
      However, nothing appears to happen&mdash;there is no output.
      After a moment, Nelle realizes that since her script doesn't print anything to the screen any longer,
      she has no idea whether it is running, much less how quickly.
      She kills the job by typing Control-C,
      uses up-arrow to repeat the command,
      and edits it to read:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt; do echo $datafile; goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done</span></pre>

    <p>When she runs her program now,
      it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:</p>

<pre class="out">NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...</pre>

    <p>1518 times 5 seconds,
      divided by 60,
      tells her that her script will take about two hours to run.
      As a final check,
      she opens another terminal window,
      goes into <code>north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</code>,
      and uses <code>cat stats-NENE01729B.txt</code>
      to examine one of the output files.
      It looks good,
      so she decides to get some coffee and catch up on her reading.</p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It</h3>

      <p>Another way to repeat previous work is to use the <code>history</code> command to
        get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and
        then to use <code>!123</code> (where "123" is replaced by the command number) to
        repeat one of those commands. For example, if Nelle types this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">history | tail -5</span>
<span class="out">  456  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  457  rm stats-NENE01729B.txt.txt
  458  goostats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
  459  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  460  history</span>
$</pre>

      <p>then she can re-run <code>goostats</code> on <code>NENE01729B.txt</code> simply by typing:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">!458</span></pre>

    <h2>Shell Scripts</h2>

    <div class="objectives">
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Write a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files.</li>
        <li>Run a shell script from the command line.</li>
        <li>Write a shell script that operates on a set of files defined by the user on the command line.</li>
        <li>Create pipelines that include user-written shell scripts.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment.
      We are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files
      so that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command.
      For historical reasons,
      a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a <a href="#gloss:shell-script">shell script</a>,
      but make no mistake:
      these are actually small programs.</p>

    <p>Let's start by putting the following line in the file <code>middle.sh</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">head -20 cholesterol.pdb | tail -5</span></pre>

    <p>This is a variation on the pipe we constructed earlier:
      it selects lines 16-20 of the file <code>cholesterol.pdb</code>.
      Remember, we are <em>not</em> running it as a command just yet:
      we are putting the commands in a file.</p>

    <p>Once we have saved the file,
      we can ask the shell to execute the commands it contains.
      Our shell is called <code>bash</code>, so we run the following command:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">bash middle.sh</span>
<span class="out">ATOM     14  C           1      -1.463  -0.666   1.001  1.00  0.00
ATOM     15  C           1       0.762  -0.929   0.295  1.00  0.00
ATOM     16  C           1       0.771  -0.937   1.840  1.00  0.00
ATOM     17  C           1      -0.664  -0.610   2.293  1.00  0.00

$</pre>

    <p>Sure enough,
      our script's output is exactly what we would get if we ran that pipeline directly.</p>

      <h3>Text vs. Whatever</h3>

      <p>We usually call programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer "text
        editors", but we need to be a bit more careful when it comes to
        programming. By default, Microsoft Word uses <code>.docx</code> files to store not
        only text, but also formatting information about fonts, headings, and so
        on. This extra information isn't stored as characters, and doesn't mean
        anything to tools like <code>head</code>: they expect input files to contain
        nothing but the letters, digits, and punctuation on a standard computer
        keyboard. When editing programs, therefore, you must either use a plain
        text editor, or be careful to save files as plain text.</p>

    <p>What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file?
      We could edit <code>middle.sh</code> each time to change the filename,
      but that would probably take longer than just retyping the command.
      Instead,
      let's edit <code>middle.sh</code> and replace <code>cholesterol.pdb</code> with a special variable called <code>$1</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cat middle.sh</span>
<span class="out">head -20 $1 | tail -5</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Inside a shell script,
      <code>$1</code> means "the first filename (or other parameter) on the command line".
      We can now run our script like this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">bash middle.sh cholesterol.pdb</span>
<span class="out">ATOM     14  C           1      -1.463  -0.666   1.001  1.00  0.00
ATOM     15  C           1       0.762  -0.929   0.295  1.00  0.00
ATOM     16  C           1       0.771  -0.937   1.840  1.00  0.00
ATOM     17  C           1      -0.664  -0.610   2.293  1.00  0.00
ATOM     18  C           1      -4.705   2.108  -0.396  1.00  0.00</span>
$</pre>

    <p>or on a different file like this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">bash middle.sh vitamin-a.pdb</span>
<span class="out">ATOM     14  C           1       1.788  -0.987  -0.861
ATOM     15  C           1       2.994  -0.265  -0.829
ATOM     16  C           1       4.237  -0.901  -1.024
ATOM     17  C           1       5.406  -0.117  -1.087
ATOM     18  C           1      -0.696  -2.628  -0.641</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We still need to edit <code>middle.sh</code> each time we want to adjust the range of lines,
      though.
      Let's fix that by using the special variables <code>$2</code> and <code>$3</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cat middle.sh</span>
<span class="out">head $2 $1 | tail $3</span>
$ <span class="in">bash middle.sh vitamin-a.pdb -20 -5</span>
<span class="out">ATOM     14  C           1       1.788  -0.987  -0.861
ATOM     15  C           1       2.994  -0.265  -0.829
ATOM     16  C           1       4.237  -0.901  -1.024
ATOM     17  C           1       5.406  -0.117  -1.087
ATOM     18  C           1      -0.696  -2.628  -0.641</span>
$</pre>

    <p>What if we want to process many files in a single pipeline?
      For example, if we want to sort our PDB files by length, we would type:</p>

<pre class="in">wc -l *.pdb | sort -n</pre>

    <p>because <code>wc -l</code> lists the number of lines in the files
      and <code>sort -n</code> sorts things numerically.
      We could put this in a file,
      but then it would only ever sort a list of PDB files in the current directory.
      If we want to be able to get a sorted list of other kinds of files,
      we need a way to get all those names into the script.
      We can't use <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, and so on
      because we don't know how many files there are.
      Instead, we use the special variable <code>$*</code>,
      which means,
      "All of the command-line parameters to the shell script."
      Here's an example:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cat sorted.sh</span>
<span class="out">wc -l $* | sort -n</span>
$ <span class="out">bash sorted.sh *.dat backup/*.dat</span>
<span class="out">      29 chloratin.dat
      89 backup/chloratin.dat
      91 sphagnoi.dat
     156 sphag2.dat
     172 backup/sphag-merged.dat
     182 girmanis.dat</span>
$</pre>

        <h3>Why Isn't It Doing Anything?</h3>

        <p>What happens if a script is supposed to process a bunch of files, but we
          don't give it any filenames? For example, what if we type:</p>

<pre>bash sorted.sh</pre>

        <p>but don't say <code>*.dat</code> (or anything else)? In this case, <code>$*</code> expands to
          nothing at all, so the pipeline inside the script is effectively:</p>

<pre>wc -l | sort -n</pre>

        <p>Since it doesn't have any filenames, <code>wc</code> assumes it is supposed to
          process standard input, so it just sits there and waits for us to give
          it some data interactively. From the outside, though, all we see is it
          sitting there: the script doesn't appear to do anything.</p>

      </blockquote>

    <p>We have two more things to do before we're finished with our simple shell scripts.
      If you look at a script like:</p>

<pre>wc -l $* | sort -n</pre>

    <p>you can probably puzzle out what it does.
      On the other hand,
      if you look at this script:</p>

<pre># List files sorted by number of lines.
wc -l $* | sort -n</pre>

    <p>you don't have to puzzle it out&mdash;the comment at the top tells you what it does.
      A line or two of documentation like this make it much easier for other people
      (including your future self)
      to re-use your work.
      The only caveat is that each time you modify the script,
      you should check that the comment is still accurate:
      an explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.</p>

    <p>Second,
      suppose we have just run a series of commands that did something useful&mdash;for example,
      that created a graph we'd like to use in a paper.
      We'd like to be able to re-create the graph later if we need to,
      so we want to save the commands in a file.
      Instead of typing them in again
      (and potentially getting them wrong)
      we can do this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">history | tail -4 &gt; redo-figure-3.sh</span></pre>

    <p>The file <code>redo-figure-3.sh</code> now contains:</p>

<pre> 297 goostats -r NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
 298 goodiff stats-NENE01729B.txt /data/validated/01729.txt &gt; 01729-differences.txt
 299 cut -d ',' -f 2-3 01729-differences.txt &gt; 01729-time-series.txt
 300 ygraph --format scatter --color bw --borders none 01729-time-series.txt figure-3.png</pre>

    <p>After a moment's work in an editor to remove the serial numbers on the commands,
      we have a completely accurate record of how we created that figure.</p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Unnumbering</h3>

      <p>Nelle could also use <code>colrm</code> (short for "column removal") to remove the
        serial numbers on her previous commands.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>In practice, most people develop shell scripts by running commands at the shell prompt a few times
      to make sure they're doing the right thing,
      then saving them in a file for re-use.
      This style of work allows people to recycle
      what they discover about their data and their workflow
      with just a few extra keystrokes.</p>

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Creating a Script</h3>

    <p>An off-hand comment from her supervisor has made Nelle realize that
      she should have provided a couple of extra parameters to <code>goostats</code> when she processed her files.
      This might have been a disaster if she had done all the analysis by hand,
      but thanks to for loops,
      it will only take a couple of hours to re-do.</p>

    <p>But experience has taught her that if something needs to be done twice,
      it will probably need to be done a third or fourth time as well.
      She runs the editor and writes the following:</p>

<pre># Calculate reduced stats for data files at J = 100 c/bp.
for datafile in $*
do
    echo $datafile
    goostats -J 100 -r $datafile stats-$datafile
done</pre>

    <p>(The parameters <code>-J 100</code> and <code>-r</code> are the ones her supervisor said she should have used.)
      She saves this in a file called <code>do-stats.sh</code>
      so that she can now re-do the first stage of her analysis by typing:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">bash do-stats.sh *[AB].txt</span></pre>

    <p>She can also do this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">bash do-stats.sh *[AB].txt | wc -l</span></pre>

    <p>so that the output is just the number of files processed
      rather than the names of the files that were processed.</p>

    <p>One thing to note about Nelle's script is that
      it lets the person running it decide what files to process.
      She could have written it as:</p>

<pre># Calculate reduced stats for  A and Site B data files at J = 100 c/bp.
for datafile in *[AB].txt
do
    echo $datafile
    goostats -J 100 -r $datafile stats-$datafile
done</pre>

    <p>The advantage is that this always selects the right files:
      she doesn't have to remember to exclude the 'Z' files.
      The disadvantage is that it <em>always</em> selects just those files&mdash;she can't run it on all files
      (including the 'Z' files),
      or on the 'G' or 'H' files her colleagues in Antarctica are producing,
      without editing the script.
      If she wanted to be more adventurous,
      she could modify her script to check for command-line parameters,
      and use <code>*[AB].txt</code> if none were provided.
      Of course, this introduces another tradeoff between flexibility and complexity.</p>

          those files separately.

        <li>
          Write a shell script called <code>longest.sh</code> that takes the name of a
          directory and a filename extension as its parameters, and prints out
          the name of the most recently modified file in that directory with
          that extension. For example:

<pre>bash largest.sh /tmp/data pdb</pre>

    <p>You can guess someone's age by how they talk about search:
      young people use "Google" as a verb,
      while crusty old Unix programmers use "grep".
      The word is a contraction of "global/regular expression/print",
      a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors.
      It is also the name of a very useful command-line program.</p>

    <p><code>grep</code> finds and prints lines in files that match a pattern.
      For our examples,
      we will use a file that contains three haikus taken from a
      <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/21st/chal/1998/01/26chal.html">1998 competition in Salon magazine</a>:</p>

<pre>The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
"My Thesis" not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.</pre>

    <p>Let's find lines that contain the word "not":</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">grep not haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">Is not the true Tao, until
"My Thesis" not found
Today it is not working</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Here, <code>not</code> is the pattern we're searching for.
      It's pretty simple:
      every alphanumeric character matches against itself.
      After the pattern comes the name or names of the files we're searching in.
      The output is the three lines in the file that contain the letters "not".</p>

    <p>Let's try a different pattern: "day".</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">grep day haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working</span>
$</pre>

    <p>This time,
      the output is lines containing the words "Yesterday" and "Today",
      which both have the letters "day".
      If we give <code>grep</code> the <code>-w</code> flag,
      it restricts matches to word boundaries,
      so that only lines with the word "day" will be printed:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">grep -w day haiku.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>In this case, there aren't any, so <code>grep</code>'s output is empty.</p>

    <p>Another useful option is <code>-n</code>, which numbers the lines that match:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">grep -n it haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">5:With searching comes loss
9:Yesterday it worked
10:Today it is not working</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Here, we can see that lines 5, 9, and 10 contain the letters "it".</p>

    <p>We can combine flags as we do with other Unix commands.
      For example,
      since <code>-i</code> makes matching case-insensitive and <code>-v</code> inverts the match,
      using them both only prints lines that <em>don't</em> match the pattern
      in any mix of upper and lower case:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">grep -i -v the haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.</span>
$</pre>

    <p><code>grep</code> has lots of other options.
      To find out what they are, we can type <code>man grep</code>.
      <code>man</code> is the Unix "manual" command:
      it prints a description of a command and its options,
      and (if you're lucky) provides a few examples of how to use it:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">man grep</span>
<span class="out">GREP(1)                                                                                              GREP(1)

NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines matching a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
       grep [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or if a single hyphen-
       minus (-) is given as file name) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.  By default, grep
       prints the matching lines.
       ...        ...        ...

OPTIONS
   Generic Program Information
       --help Print  a  usage  message  briefly summarizing these command-line options and the bug-reporting
              address, then exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of grep to the standard output stream.  This version number should be
              included in all bug reports (see below).

   Matcher Selection
       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret  PATTERN  as  an  extended regular expression (ERE, see below).  (-E is specified by
              POSIX.)

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines, any of  which  is  to  be
              matched.  (-F is specified by POSIX.)
    ...        ...        ...</span>

      <h3>Wildcards</h3>

      <p><code>grep</code>'s real power doesn't come from its options, though; it comes from
        the fact that patterns can include wildcards. (The technical name for
        these is <a href="#gloss:regular-expression">regular expressions</a>, which
        is what the "re" in "grep" stands for.) Regular expressions are complex
        enough that we devoted an entire section of the website to them; if you
        want to do complex searches, please check it out. As a taster, we can
        find lines that have an 'o' in the second position like this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">grep -E '^.o' haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">You bring fresh toner.
Today it is not working
Software is like that.</span>
$</pre>

      <p>We use the <code>-E</code> flag and put the pattern in quotes to prevent the shell
        from trying to interpret it. (If the pattern contained a '*', for
        example, the shell would try to expand it before running <code>grep</code>.) The
        '\^' in the pattern anchors the match to the start of the line. The '.'
        matches a single character (just like '?' in the shell), while the 'o'
        matches an actual 'o'.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>While <code>grep</code> finds lines in files,
      the <code>find</code> command finds files themselves.
      Again,
      it has a lot of options;
      to show how the simplest ones work, we'll use the directory tree shown below.</p>

    <p><img src="bash/novice/img/find-file-tree.svg" alt="File Tree for Find Example" /></p>

    <p>Vlad's home directory contains one file called <code>notes.txt</code> and four subdirectories:
      <code>thesis</code> (which is sadly empty),
      <code>data</code> (which contains two files <code>first.txt</code> and <code>second.txt</code>),
      a <code>tools</code> directory that contains the programs <code>format</code> and <code>stats</code>,
      and an empty subdirectory called <code>old</code>.</p>

    <p>For our first command,
      let's run <code>find . -type d</code>.
      <code>.</code> (i.e., the current working directory) is where we want our search to start;
      <code>-type d</code> means "things that are directories".
      Sure enough,
      <code>find</code>'s output is the names of the five directories in our little tree
      (including <code>.</code>):</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">find . -type d</span>
<span class="out">./
./data
./thesis
./tools
./tools/old</span>
$</pre>

    <p>If we change <code>-type d</code> to <code>-type f</code>,
      we get a listing of all the files instead:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">find . -type f</span>
<span class="out">./data/first.txt
./data/second.txt
./notes.txt
./tools/format
./tools/stats</span>
$</pre>

    <p><code>find</code> automatically goes into subdirectories,
      their subdirectories,
      and so on to find everything that matches the pattern we've given it.
      If we don't want it to,
      we can use <code>-maxdepth</code> to restrict the depth of search:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">find . -maxdepth 1 -type f</span>
<span class="out">./notes.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The opposite of <code>-maxdepth</code> is <code>-mindepth</code>,
      which tells <code>find</code> to only report things that are at or below a certain depth.
      <code>-mindepth 2</code> therefore finds all the files that are two or more levels below us:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">find . -mindepth 2 -type f</span>
<span class="out">./data/first.txt
./data/second.txt
./tools/format
./tools/stats</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Another option is <code>-empty</code>,
      which restricts matches to empty files and directories:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">find . -empty</span>
<span class="out">./thesis
./tools/old</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Now let's try matching by name:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">find . -name *.txt</span>
<span class="out">./notes.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We expected it to find all the text files,
      but it only prints out <code>./notes.txt</code>.
      The problem is that the shell expands wildcard characters like <code>*</code> <em>before</em> commands run.
      Since <code>*.txt</code> in the current directory expands to <code>notes.txt</code>,
      the command we actually ran was:</p>

<pre class="in">find . -name notes.txt</pre>

    <p><code>find</code> did what we asked; we just asked for the wrong thing.</p>

    <p>To get what we want,
      let's do what we did with <code>grep</code>:
      put <code>*.txt</code> in single quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the <code>*</code> wildcard.
      This way,
      <code>find</code> actually gets the pattern <code>*.txt</code>, not the expanded filename <code>notes.txt</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">find . -name '*.txt'</span>
<span class="out">./data/first.txt
./data/second.txt
./notes.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>As we said earlier,
      the command line's power lies in combining tools.
      We've seen how to do that with pipes;
      let's look at another technique.
      As we just saw,
      <code>find . -name '*.txt'</code> gives us a list of all text files in or below the current directory.
      How can we combine that with <code>wc -l</code> to count the lines in all those files?</p>

    <p>The simplest way is to put the <code>find</code> command inside <code>$()</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">wc -l $(find . -name '*.txt')</span>
<span class="out">  70  ./data/first.txt
 420  ./data/second.txt
  30  ./notes.txt
 520  total</span>
$</pre>

    <p>When the shell executes this command,
      the first thing it does is run whatever is inside the <code>$()</code>.
      It then replaces the <code>$()</code> expression with that command's output.
      Since the output of <code>find</code> is the three filenames <code>./data/first.txt</code>,
      <code>./data/second.txt</code>,
      and <code>./notes.txt</code>,
      the shell constructs the command:</p>

<pre>wc -l ./data/first.txt ./data/second.txt ./notes.txt</pre>

    <p>which is what we wanted.
      This expansion is exactly what the shell does when it expands wildcards like <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>,
      but lets us use any command we want as our own "wildcard".</p>

    <p>It's very common to use <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> together.
      The first finds files that match a pattern;
      the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.
      Here, for example, we can find PDB files that contain iron atoms
      by looking for the string "FE" in all the <code>.pdb</code> files below the current directory:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">grep FE $(find . -name '*.pdb')</span>
<span class="out">./human/heme.pdb:ATOM  25  FE  1  -0.924  0.535  -0.518</span>
$</pre>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Binary Files</h3>

      <p>We have focused exclusively on finding things in text files. What if
        your data is stored as images, in databases, or in some other format?
        One option would be to extend tools like <code>grep</code> to handle those formats.
        This hasn't happened, and probably won't, because there are too many
        formats to support.</p>

      <p>The second option is to convert the data to text, or extract the
        text-ish bits from the data. This is probably the most common approach,
        since it only requires people to build one tool per data format (to
        extract information). On the one hand, it makes simple things easy to
        do. On the negative side, complex things are usually impossible. For
        example, it's easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y
        dimensions from image files for <code>grep</code> to play with, but how would you
        write something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained
        formulas?</p>

      <p>The third choice is to recognize that the shell and text processing have
        their limits, and to use a programming language such as Python instead.
        When the time comes to do this, don't be too hard on the shell: many
        modern programming languages, Python included, have borrowed a lot of
        ideas from it, and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise.</p>

    <h1 id="s:git">Version Control with Git</h1>

    <p>Wolfman and Dracula have been hired by Universal Missions
      (a space services spinoff from Euphoric State University)
      to figure out where the company should send its next planetary lander.
      They want to be able to work on the plans at the same time,
      but they have run into problems doing this in the past.
      If they take turns,
      each one will spend a lot of time waiting for the other to finish,
      but if they work on their own copies and email changes back and forth
      things will be lost, overwritten, or duplicated.</p>

    <p>The right solution is to use <a href="../gloss.html#version-control">version control</a>
      to manage their work.
      Version control is better than mailing files back and forth because:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost.
        This means it can be used like the "undo" feature in an editor,
        and since all old versions of files are saved
        it's always possible to go back in time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day,
        or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.</li>
      <li>It keeps a record of who made what changes when,
        so that if people have questions later on,
        they know who to ask.</li>
      <li>It's hard (but not impossible) to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone's changes,
        because the version control system highlights them automatically.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This lesson shows how to use
      a popular open source version control system called Git.
      It is more complex than some alternatives,
      but it is widely used,
      primarily because of a hosting site called <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.
      No matter which version control system you use,
      the most important thing to learn is not the details of their more obscure commands,
      but the workflow that they encourage.</p>

    <p>Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world:
      it's what professionals use to keep track of what they've done
      and to collaborate with other people.
      Every large software development project relies on it,
      and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well.
      And it isn't just for software:
      books (like this one),
      papers,
      small data sets,
      and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared
      can and should be stored in a version control system.</p>

    <h2>A Better Kind of Backup</h2>

    <p>The first time we use Git on a new machine,
      we need to configure a few things:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"</span>
$ <span class="in">git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"</span>
$ <span class="in">git config --global color.ui "auto"</span>
$ <span class="in">git config --global core.editor "nano"</span>
$</pre>

    <p>(Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's,
      and please make sure you choose an editor that's actually on your system
      rather than <code>nano</code>.)</p>

    <p>Git commands are written <code>git verb</code>,
      where <code>verb</code> is what we actually want it to do.
      In this case,
      we're telling Git:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>our name and email address,</li>
      <li>to colorize output,</li>
      <li>what our favorite text editor is, and</li>
      <li>that we want to use these settings globally (i.e., for every project),</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The four commands above only need to be run once:
      Git will remember the settings until we change them.
      Once Git is configured,
      we can start using Git.
      Let's create a directory for our work:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">mkdir planets</span>
$ <span class="in">cd planets</span>
$</pre>

    <p>and tell Git to make it a <a href="../gloss.html#repository">repository</a>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git init</span>
$</pre>

    <p>If we use <code>ls</code> to show the directory's contents,
      it appears that nothing has changed:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls</span>
$</pre>

    <p>But if we add the <code>-a</code> flag to show everything,
      we can see that Git has created a hidden directory called <code>.git</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -a</span>
<span class="out">.       ..      .git</span>
</pre>

    <p>Git stores information about the project in this special sub-directory.
      If we ever delete it,
      we will lose the project's history.</p>

    <p>We can ask Git for the status of our project at any time like this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git status</span>
<span class="out"># On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We'll explain what <code>branch master</code> means later.
      For the moment,
      let's add some notes about Mars's suitability as a base.
      (We'll <code>cat</code> the text in the file after we edit it so that you can see what we're doing,
      but in real life this isn't necessary.
      We'll also insert blank lines between groups of shell commands to make them easier to read.)</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">nano mars.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">mars.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">git status</span>
<span class="out"># On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       mars.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
      that Git isn't keeping track of.
      We can tell Git that it should do so like this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git add mars.txt</span></pre>

    <p>and check that the right thing happened like this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git status</span>
<span class="out"># On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#       new file:   mars.txt
#</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of this file,
      but it hasn't yet recorded any changes for posterity.
      To get it to do that,
      we need to run one more command:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git commit -m "Starting to think about Mars"</span>
<span class="out">[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Starting to think about Mars
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>When we run <code>git commit</code>,
      Git takes everything we have told it to save using <code>git add</code>
      and stores a copy permanently inside the special <code>.git</code> directory.
      This permanent copy is called a <a href="#gloss:revision">revision</a>.
      We use the <code>-m</code> flag (for "message")
      to record a comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
      If we just run <code>git commit</code> without the <code>-m</code> option,
      Git will launch <code>nano</code> (or whatever other editor we configured at the start)
      so that we can write a longer message.</p>

    <p>If we run <code>git status</code> now:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git status</span>
<span class="out"># On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean</span>
$</pre>

    <p>it tells us everything is up to date.
      If we want to know what we've done recently,
      we can ask Git to show us the project's history:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git log</span>
<span class="out">commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b

$</pre>

    <p>Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">nano mars.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

$</pre>

    <p>We don't need to run <code>git add</code> again,
      because Git already knows this file is on the list of things it's managing.
      If we run <code>git status</code>,
      it tells us the file has been modified:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git status</span>
<span class="out"># On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)

#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The last line is the key phrase:
      "no changes added to commit".
      We have changed this file,
      but we haven't committed to making those changes yet.
      Let's double-check our work using <code>git diff</code>,
      which shows us the differences between
      the current state of the file
      and the most recently saved version:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git diff</span>
<span class="out">diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt

    <p>The output is cryptic because
      it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and <code>patch</code>
      telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
      If we can break it down into pieces:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The first line tells us that Git is using the Unix <code>diff</code> command
        to compare the old and new versions of the file.</li>
      <li>The second line tells exactly which <a href="#gloss:revision">revisions</a> of the file
        Git is comparing;
        <code>df0654a</code> and <code>315bf3a</code> are unique computer-generated labels for those revisions.</li>
      <li>The remaining lines show us the actual differences
        and the lines on which they occur.
        The numbers between the <code>@@</code> markers indicate which lines we're changing;
        the <code>+</code> on the lines below show that we are adding lines.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Let's commit our change:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git commit -m "Concerns about Mars's moons on my furry friend"</span>

    <p>Whoops:
      Git won't commit because we didn't use <code>git add</code> first.
      Let's do that:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git add mars.txt</span>

$</pre>

    <p>Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
      before actually committing anything
      because we often won't commit everything at once.
      For example,
      suppose we're adding a few citations to our supervisor's work
      to our thesis.
      We might want to commit those additions,
      and the corresponding addition to the bibliography,
      but <em>not</em> commit the work we've been doing on the conclusion.
      To allow for this,
      Git has a special staging area
      where it keeps track of things that have been added to
      the current <a href="../gloss.html#change-set">change set</a>
      but not yet committed.
      <code>git add</code> puts things in this area,
      and <code>git commit</code> then copies them to long-term storage:</p>

    <p><code>HEAD</code> means "the most recently saved version".
      <code>HEAD~1</code> (pronounced "head minus one")
      means "the previous revision".
      We can also refer to revisions using
      those long strings of digits and letters
      that <code>git log</code> displays.
      These are unique IDs for the changes,
      and "unique" really does mean unique:
      every change to any set of files on any machine
      has a unique 40-character identifier.
      Our first commit was given the ID
      f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b,
      so let's try this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt</span>

    <p>That's the right answer,
      but typing random 40-character strings is annoying,

    <p>All right:
      we can save changes to files and see what we've changed&mdash;how
      can we restore older versions of things?
      Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">nano mars.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">We will need to manufacture our own oxygen</span>
$</pre>

    <p><code>git status</code> now tells us that the file has been changed,
      but those changes haven't been staged:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git status</span>
<span class="out"># On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We can put things back the way they were like this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git reset -hard HEAD</span>
<span class="out">HEAD is now at 005937f Thoughts about the climate</span>
$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity</span>
$</pre>

    <p>The <code>--hard</code> argument to <code>git reset</code> tells it to throw away local changes:
      without that,
      <code>git reset</code> won't destroy our work.
      <code>HEAD</code> tells <code>git reset</code> that we want to put things back to
      the way they were recorded in the <code>HEAD</code> revision.
      (Remember,
      we haven't done a <code>git commit</code> with these changes yet,
      so <code>HEAD</code> is still where it was.)
      We can use <code>git reset --hard HEAD~55</code> and so on
      to back up to earlier revisions,
      <code>git reset --hard 34961b1</code> to back up to a particular revision,
      and so on.</p>

    <p>But what if we want to recover some files without losing other work we've done since?
      For example,
      what if we have added some material to the conclusion of our paper that we'd like to keep,
      but we want to get back an earlier version of the introduction?
      In that case,
      we want to check out an older revision of the file,
      so we do something like this:</p>

<pre class="in">git checkout 123456 mars.txt</pre>

    <p>but use the first few digits of an actual revision number instead of 123456.
      To get the right answer,
      we must use the revision number that identifies the state of the repository
      <em>before</em> the change we're trying to undo.
      A common mistake is to use the revision number of
      the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of:</p>

    <p><img src="bash/novice/img/git-when-revisions-updated.svg" alt="When Git Updates Revision Numbers" /></p>

    <p>The fact that files can be reverted one by one
      tends to change the way people organize their work.
      If everything is in one large document,
      it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
      without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
      If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
      on the other hand,
      moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.</p>

    <h2>Collaborating</h2>

    <p>Version control really comes into its own
      when we begin to collaborate with other people.
      We already have most of the machinery we need to do this;
      the only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.</p>

    <p>Systems like Git and Mercurial allow us to move work between any two repositories.
      In practice,
      though,
      it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub,
      and to keep it on the web rather than on someone's laptop.
      Most programmers use hosting services like <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="http://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>
      to hold those master copies;
      we'll explore the pros and cons of this in the final section of this lesson.</p>

    <p>Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the world.
      Log in to GitHub,
      then create a new repository called <code>planets</code>
      using their GUI:</p>

    <p><img src="git/novice/img/github-create-repo-01.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)" /></p>

    <p><img src="git/novice/img/github-create-repo-02.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)" /></p>

    <p><img src="git/novice/img/github-create-repo-03.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)" /></p>

    <p>This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">mkdir planets</span>
$ <span class="in">cd planets</span>
$ <span class="in">git init</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Our local repository still contains our earlier work on <code>mars.txt</code>,
      but the remote repository on GitHub doesn't contain any files yet:</p>

    <p><img src="git/novice/img/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg" alt="Freshly-Made GitHub Repository" /></p>

    <p>The next step is to connect the two repositories.
      We do this by making the GitHub repository a <a href="../gloss.html#repository-remote">remote</a>
      for the local repository.
      The home page of the repository on GitHub includes
      the string we need to identify it:</p>

    <p><img src="git/novice/img/github-find-repo-string.png" alt="Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub" /></p>

    <p>For now,
      we'll use the 'http' <a href="#gloss:protocol">protocol</a>
      (which is also used by web browsers)
      since it requires the least setup.
      Copy that URL from the browser,
      go into the local <code>planets</code> repository,
      and run this command:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets</span>
$</pre>

    <p>(using your GitHub ID instead of <code>vlad</code>).
      We can check that the command has worked by running <code>git remote -v</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git remote -v</span>
<span class="out">origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (fetch)</span></pre>

    <p>There's nothing magic about the name <code>origin</code>,
      but we'll see in a moment why it's a sensible choice.
      Once this is set up,
      this command will push the changes from our local repository
      to the repository on GitHub:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git push origin master</span>
<span class="out">Counting objects: 9, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 821 bytes, done.
Total 9 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * [new branch]      master -&gt; master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Our local and remote repositories are now in this state:</p>

    <p><img src="git/novice/img/github-repo-after-first-push.svg" alt="GitHub Repository After First Push" /></p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>The '-u' Flag</h3>

      <p>You may see a <code>-u</code> option used with <code>git push</code>.
        This tells Git what <a href="#gloss:branch">branch</a> to use
        in the repository you're pushing to.
        We discuss branches and branching in our intermediate-level lessons.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git pull origin master</span>
<span class="out">From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Pulling has no effect in this case
      because the two repositories are already synchronized.
      If someone else had pushed some changes,
      though,
      this command would download them to our local repository.
      We can simulate this by going to another directory&mdash;for example, <code>/tmp</code>&mdash;and
      <a href="../gloss.html#repository-clone">cloning</a> our GitHub repository:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cd /tmp</span>
$ <span class="in">git clone https://github.com/vlad/planets.git</span>
$</pre>

    <p><code>git clone</code> creates a fresh local copy of a remote repository.
      (We did it in <code>/tmp</code> or some other directory so that we don't overwrite our existing <code>planets</code> directory.)
      Our computer now has two copies of the repository:</p>

    <p><img src="git/novice/img/git-after-duplicate-clone.svg" alt="After Creating Duplicate Clone of Repository" /></p>

    <p>Let's make a change in the copy in <code>/tmp/planets</code>:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cd /tmp/planets</span>
$ <span class="in">nano pluto.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">cat pluto.txt</span>
<span class="out">It is so a planet!</span>
$ <span class="in">git add pluto.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">git commit -m "Some notes about Pluto"</span>
<span class="out"> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>then push the change to GitHub:</p>

<span class="out">Counting objects: 4, done.

    <p><img src="git/novice/img/git-after-change-to-duplicate-repo.svg" alt="After Pushing Change from Duplicate Repository" /></p>

    <p>We can now download changes into the original repository on our machine:</p>

$ <span class="in">git pull origin master</span>
<span class="out">remote: Counting objects: 4, done.

$</pre>

    <p>In practice,
      we would probably never have two copies of the same remote repository
      on our laptop at once.
      Instead,
      one of those copies would be on our laptop,
      and the other on a lab machine,
      or on someone else's computer.
      Pushing and pulling changes gives us a reliable way
      to share work between different people and machines.</p>

    <h2>Conflicts</h2>

    <p>As soon as people can work in parallel,
      someone's going to step on someone else's toes.
      This will even happen with a single person:
      if we are working on a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab,
      we could make different changes to each copy.
      Version control helps us manage these <a href="../gloss.html#conflict">conflicts</a>
      by giving us tools to <a href="../gloss.html#resolve">resolve</a> overlapping changes.</p>

    <p>To see how we can resolve conflicts,
      we must first create one.
      The file <code>mars.txt</code> currently looks like this
      in both local copies of our <code>planets</code> repository
      (the one in our home directory and the one in <code>/tmp</code>):</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Let's add a line to the copy under our home directory:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">nano mars.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

$</pre>

    <p>and then push the change to GitHub:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git add mars.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">git commit -m "Adding a line in our home copy"</span>
<span class="out">[master 5ae9631] Adding a line in our home copy

    <p>Our repositories are now in this state:</p>

    <p><img src="git/novice/img/git-after-first-conficting-change.svg" alt="After Making First Change" /></p>

    <p>Now let's switch to the copy under <code>/tmp</code>
      and make a different change there
      <em>without</em> updating from GitHub:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cd /tmp/planets</span>
$ <span class="in">nano mars.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

We added a different line in the temporary copy</span>
$</pre>

    <p>We can commit the change locally:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git add mars.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">git commit -m "Adding a line in the temporary copy"</span>
<span class="out">[master 07ebc69] Adding a line in the temporary copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</span>
$</pre>

    <p>but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git push origin master</span>
<span class="out">To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git

$</pre>

    <p>Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other
      and stops us from trampling on our previous work.
      What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub,
      <a href="../gloss.html#repository-merge">merge</a> them into the copy we're currently working in,
      and then push that.
      Let's start by pulling:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git pull origin master</span>
<span class="out">remote: Counting objects: 5, done.

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</span>
$</pre>

    <p><code>git pull</code> tells us there's a conflict,
      and marks that conflict in the affected file:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d</span>
$</pre>

    <p>Our change&mdash;the one in <code>HEAD</code>&mdash;is preceded by <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>.
      Git has then inserted <code>=======</code> as a separator between the conflicting changes
      and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.
      (The string of letters and digits after that marker
      identifies the revision we've just downloaded.)</p>

    <p>It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
      and reconcile the changes.
      We can do anything we want:
      keep the change in this branch,
      keep the change made in the other,
      write something new to replace both,
      or get rid of the change entirely.
      Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman

    <p>To finish merging,

    <p>We don't need to merge again because GitHub knows someone has already done that.</p>

    <p>Version control's ability to merge conflicting changes
      is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into multiple files
      instead of storing everything in one large file.
      There's another benefit too:
      whenever there are repeated conflicts in a particular file,
      the version control system is essentially trying to tell its users
      that they ought to clarify who's responsible for what,
      or find a way to divide the work up differently.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Free sharing of information might be the ideal in science,
      but the reality is often more complicated.
      Normal practice today looks something like this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A scientist collects some data and stores it on a machine
        that is occasionally backed up by her department.</li>
      <li>She then writes or modifies a few small programs
        (which also reside on her machine)
        to analyze that data.</li>
      <li>Once she has some results,
        she writes them up and submits her paper.
        She might include her data&mdash;a growing number of journals require this&mdash;but
        she probably doesn't include her code.</li>
      <li>Time passes.</li>
      <li>The journal sends her reviews written anonymously by a handful of other people in her field.
        She revises her paper to satisfy them,
        during which time she might also modify the scripts she wrote earlier,
        and resubmits.</li>
      <li>More time passes.</li>
      <li>The paper is eventually published.
        It might include a link to an online copy of her data,
        but the paper itself will be behind a paywall:
        only people who have personal or institutional access
        will be able to read it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For a growing number of scientists,
      though,
      the process looks like this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The data that the scientist collects is stored in an open access repository
        like <a href="http://figshare.com/">figshare</a> or <a href="http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a>
        as soon as it's collected,
        and given its own DOI.</li>
      <li>The scientist creates a new repository on GitHub to hold her work.</li>
      <li>As she does her analysis,
        she pushes changes to her scripts
        (and possibly some output files)
        to that repository.
        She also uses the repository for her paper;
        that repository is then the hub for collaboration with her colleagues.</li>
      <li>When she's happy with the state of her paper,
        she posts a version to <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>
        or some other preprint server
        to invite feedback from peers.</li>
      <li>Based on that feedback,
        she may post several revisions
        before finally submitting her paper to a journal.</li>
      <li>The published paper includes links to her preprint
        and to her code and data repositories,
        which  makes it much easier for other scientists
        to use her work as starting point for their own research.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This open model accelerates discovery:
      the more open work is,
      the more widely it is cited and re-used.
      However,
      people who want to work this way need to make some decisions
      about what exactly "open" means in practice.</p>

    <h3>Licensing</h3>

    <p>The first question is licensing.
      Broadly speaking,
      there are two kinds of open license for software,
      and half a dozen for data and publications.
      For software,
      people can choose between the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0">GNU Public License</a> (GPL) on the one hand,
      and licenses like the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>
      and <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">BSD</a> licenses on the other.
      All of these licenses allow unrestricted sharing and modification of programs,
      but the GPL is <a href="../gloss.html#infective-license">infective</a>:
      anyone who distributes a modified version of the code
      (or anything that includes GPL'd code)
      must make <em>their</em> code freely available as well.</p>

    <p>Proponents of the GPL argue that this requirement is needed
      to ensure that people who are benefiting from freely-available code
      are also contributing back to the community.
      Opponents counter that many open source projects have had long and successful lives
      without this condition,
      and that the GPL makes it more difficult to combine code from different sources.
      At the end of the day,
      what matters most is that:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>every project have a file in its home directory
        called something like <code>LICENSE</code> or <code>LICENSE.txt</code>
        that clearly states what the license is, and</li>
      <li>people use existing licenses rather than writing new ones.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The second point is as important as the first:
      most scientists are not lawyers,
      so wording that may seem sensible to a layperson
      may have unintended gaps or consequences.
      The <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>
      maintains a list of open source licenses,
      and <a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/">tl;drLegal</a> explains many of them in plain English.</p>

    <p>When it comes to data, publications, and the like,
      scientists have many more options to choose from.
      The good news is that an organization called [Creative Commons(http://creativecommons.org/)
      has prepared a set of licenses using combinations of four basic restrictions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Attribution: derived works must give the original author credit for their work.</li>
      <li>No Derivatives: people may copy the work, but must pass it along unchanged.</li>
      <li>Share Alike: derivative works must license their work under the same terms as the original.</li>
      <li>Noncommercial: free use is allowed, but commercial use is not.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These four restrictions are abbreviated "BY", "ND", "SA", and "NC" respectively,
      so "CC-BY-ND" means,
      "People can re-use the work both for free and commercially,
      but cannot make changes and must cite the original."
      These <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">short descriptions</a>
      summarize the six CC licenses in plain language,
      and include links to their full legal formulations.</p>

    <p>There is one other important license that doesn't fit into this categorization.
      Scientists (and other people) can choose to put material in the public domain,
      which is often abbreviated "PD".
      In this case,
      anyone can do anything they want with it,
      without needing to cite the original
      or restrict further re-use.
      The table below shows how the six Creative Commons licenses and PD relate to one another:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td colspan="7" align="center">Licenses that can be used for derivative work or adaptation</td>

    </table>

    <p><a href="http://software-carpentry.org/license.html">Software Carpentry</a>
      uses CC-BY for its lessons and the MIT License for its code
      in order to encourage the widest possible re-use.
      Again,
      the most important thing is for the <code>LICENSE</code> file in the root directory of your project
      to state clearly what your license is.
      You may also want to include a file called <code>CITATION</code> or <code>CITATION.txt</code>
      that describes how to reference your project;
      the one for Software Carpentry states:</p>

<pre>To reference Software Carpentry in publications, please cite both of the following:

}</pre>

    <h3>Hosting</h3>

    <p>The second big question for groups that want to open up their work
      is where to host their code and data.
      One option is for the lab, the department, or the university to provide a server,
      manage accounts and backups,
      and so on.
      The main benefit of this is that it clarifies who owns what,
      which is particularly important if any of the material is sensitive
      (i.e.,
      relates to experiments involving human subjects
      or may be used in a patent application).
      The main drawbacks are the cost of providing the service and its longevity:
      a scientist who has spent ten years collecting data
      would like to be sure that data will still be available ten years from now,
      but that's well beyond the lifespan of most of the grants that fund academic infrastructure.</p>

    <p>The alternative is to use a public hosting service like <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>,
      <a href="http://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>,
      <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a>,
      or <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.
      All of these allow people to create repositories through a web interface,
      and also provide mailing lists,
      ways to keep track of who's doing what,
      and so on.
      They all benefit from economies of scale and network effects:
      it's easier to run one large service well
      than to run many smaller services to the same standard,
      and it's also easier for people to collaborate if they're using the same service,
      not least because it gives them fewer passwords to remember.</p>

    <p>However,
      all of these services place some constraints on people's work.
      In particular,
      most give users a choice:
      if they're willing to share their work with others,
      it will be hosted for free,
      but if they want privacy,
      they may have to pay.
      Sharing might seem like the only valid choice for science,
      but many institutions may not allow researchers to do this,
      either because they want to protect future patent applications
      or simply because what's new is often also frightening.</p>

    <h1 id="s:python">Programming with Python</h1>

    <p>We are studying inflammation in patients who have been given a new treatment for arthritis,
      and need to analyze the first dozen data sets.
      The data sets are stored in <a href="#gloss:csv">comma-separated values</a> (CSV)
      format:
      each row holds information for a single patient,
      and the columns represent successive days.
      The first few rows of our first file look like this:</p>

<pre>0,0,1,3,1,2,4,7,8,3,3,3,10,5,7,4,7,7,12,18,6,13,11,11,7,7,4,6,8,8,4,4,5,7,3, 4,2,3,0,0
0,1,2,1,2,1,3,2,2,6,10,11,5,9,4,4,7,16,8,6,18,4,12,5,12,7,11,5,11,3,3,5,4,4,5,5,1,1,0,1
0,1,1,3,3,2,6,2,5,9,5,7,4,5,4,15,5,11,9,10,19,14,12,17,7,12,11,7,4,2,10,5,4,2,2,3,2,2,1,1
0,0,2,0,4,2,2,1,6,7,10,7,9,13,8,8,15,10,10,7,17,4,4,7,6,15,6,4,9,11,3,5,6,3,3,4,2,3,2,1
0,1,1,3,3,1,3,5,2,4,4,7,6,5,3,10,8,10,6,17,9,14,9,7,13,9,12,6,7,7,9,6,3,2,2,4,2,0,1,1</pre>

    <p>We want to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>load that data into memory,</li>
      <li>calculate the average inflammation per day across all patients, and</li>
      <li>plot the result.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To do all that, we'll have to learn a little bit about programming.</p>

    <p>The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
      so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task:
      data analysis.</p>

    <p>Our real goal isn't to teach you Python,
      but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on.
      We use Python in our lessons because:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>we have to use <em>something</em> for examples;</li>
      <li>it's free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;</li>
      <li>it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists; and</li>
      <li>experience shows that it's easier for novices to pick up than most other languages.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="objectives">
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Explain what a library is, and what libraries are used for.</li>
        <li>Load a Python library and use the things it contains.</li>
        <li>Read tabular data from a file into a program.</li>
        <li>Assign values to variables.</li>

        <li>Perform operations on arrays of data.</li>
        <li>Display simple graphs.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Loading Data</h3>

    <p>In order to load the data,
      we need to <a href="#gloss:import">import</a> a library called NumPy
      that knows how to operate on matrices:</p>

<pre><span class="in">import numpy</span></pre>

    <p>We can now ask NumPy to read our data file:</p>

<pre><span class="in">numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')</span>
<span class="out">array([[ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  3.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  2., ...,  1.,  0.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  2.,  1.,  1.],
       ...,
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  2.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  0.]])</span></pre>

    <p>The expression <code>numpy.loadtxt(...)</code> means,
      "Run the function <code>loadtxt</code> that belongs to the <code>numpy</code> library."
      This <a href="#gloss:dotted-notation">dotted notation</a> is used everywhere in Python
      to refer to the parts of larger things.</p>

    <p><code>numpy.loadtxt</code> has two <a href="#gloss:parameter">parameters</a>:
      the name of the file we want to read,
      and the <a href="#gloss:delimiter">delimiter</a> that separates values on a line.
      These both need to be character strings (or <a href="#gloss:string">strings</a>
      for short),
      so we put them in quotes.</p>

    <p>When we are finished typing and press Shift+Enter,
      the notebook runs our command and shows us its output.
      In this case,
      the output is the data we just loaded.</p>

    <p>Our call to <code>numpy.loadtxt</code> read data into memory,
      but didn't save it anywhere.
      To do that,
      we need to <a href="#gloss:assignment">assign</a> the array to a
      <a href="#gloss:variable">variable</a>.
      A variable is just a name for some data,
      like <code>x</code>, <code>current_temperature</code>, or <code>subject_id</code>.
      We assign a new value to a variable using <code>=</code> like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">weight_kg = 55</span></pre>

    <p>Once a variable has a value, we can print it:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print weight_kg</span>
<span class="out">55</span></pre>

    <p>and do arithmetic with it:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'weight in pounds:', 2.2 * weight_kg</span>
<span class="out">weight in pounds: 121.0</span></pre>

    <p>We can also change a variable's value by assigning it a new one:</p>

<pre><span class="in">weight_kg = 57.5
print 'weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg</span>
<span class="out">weight in kilograms is now: 57.5</span></pre>

    <p>As the example above shows,
      we can print several things at once by separating them with commas.</p>

    <p>If we imagine the variable as a sticky note with a name written on it,
      assignment is like putting the sticky note on a particular value:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-sticky-note-variables-01.svg" alt="Variables as Sticky Notes" /></p>

    <p>This means that assigning a value to one variable does <em>not</em> change the values
      of other variables.
      For example,
      let's store the subject's weight in pounds in a variable:</p>

<pre><span class="in">weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg
print 'weight in kilograms:', weight_kg, 'and in pounds:', weight_lb</span>
<span class="out">weight in kilograms: 57.5 and in pounds: 126.5</span></pre>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-sticky-note-variables-02.svg" alt="Creating Another Variable" /></p>

    <p>and then change <code>weight_kg</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">weight_kg = 100.0
print 'weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg, 'and weight in pounds is still:', weight_lb</span>
<span class="out">weight in kilograms is now: 100.0 and weight in pounds is still: 126.5</span></pre>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-sticky-note-variables-03.svg" alt="Updating a Variable" /></p>

    <p>Since <code>weight_lb</code> doesn't "remember" where its value came from,
      it isn't automatically updated when <code>weight_kg</code> changes.
      This is different from the way spreadsheets work.</p>

    <p>Now that we know how to assign things to variables,
      let's re-run <code>numpy.loadtxt</code> and save its result:</p>

    <pre>data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')</pre>

    <p>This statement doesn't produce any output because assignment doesn't display
      anything.
      If we want to check that our data has been loaded,
      we can print the variable's value:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print data</span>
<span class="out">[[ 0.  0.  1. ...,  3.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  1.  2. ...,  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 0.  1.  1. ...,  2.  1.  1.]
 ...,
 [ 0.  1.  1. ...,  1.  1.  1.]
 [ 0.  0.  0. ...,  0.  2.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  1. ...,  1.  1.  0.]]</span></pre>

    <h3>Manipulating Data</h3>

    <p>Now that our data is in memory,
      we can start doing things with it.
      First,
      let's ask what <a href="#gloss:data-type">type</a> of thing <code>data</code> refers to:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print type(data)</span>
<span class="out">&lt;type 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;</span></pre>

    <p>The output tells us that <code>data</code> currently refers to an N-dimensional array
      created by the NumPy library.
      We can see what its <a href="#gloss:shape">shape</a> is like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print data.shape</span>
<span class="out">(60, 40)</span></pre>

    <p>This tells us that <code>data</code> has 60 rows and 40 columns.
      <code>data.shape</code> is a <a href="#gloss:member">member</a> of <code>data</code>,
      i.e.,
      a value that is stored as part of a larger value.
      We use the same dotted notation for the members of values
      that we use for the functions in libraries
      because they have the same part-and-whole relationship.</p>

    <p>If we want to get a single value from the matrix,
      we must provide an <a href="#gloss:index">index</a>,
      just as we do in math:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'first value in data:', data[0, 0]</span>
<span class="out">first value in data: 0.0</span>
<span class="in">print 'middle value in data:', data[30, 20]</span>
<span class="out">middle value in data: 13.0</span></pre>

    <p>The expression <code>data[30, 20]</code> may not surprise you,
      but <code>data[0, 0]</code> might.
      Programming languages like Fortran and MATLAB start counting at 1,
      because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
      Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
      because that's simpler for computers to do.
      As a result,
      if we have an M&times;N array in Python,
      its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis
      and 0 to N-1 on the second.
      It takes a bit of getting used to,
      but one way to remember the rule is that
      the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we
      want.</p>

    <p>An index like <code>[30, 20]</code> selects a single element of an array,
      but we can select whole sections as well.
      For example,
      we can select the first ten days (columns) of values
      for the first four (rows) patients like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print data[0:4, 0:10]</span>
<span class="out">[[ 0.  0.  1.  3.  1.  2.  4.  7.  8.  3.]
 [ 0.  1.  2.  1.  2.  1.  3.  2.  2.  6.]
 [ 0.  1.  1.  3.  3.  2.  6.  2.  5.  9.]
 [ 0.  0.  2.  0.  4.  2.  2.  1.  6.  7.]]</span></pre>

    <p>The <a href="#gloss:slice">slice</a> <code>0:4</code> means,
      "Start at index 0 and go up to, but not including, index 4."
      Again,
      the up-to-but-not-including takes a bit of getting used to,
      but the rule is that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is the
      number of values in the slice.</p>

    <p>We don't have to start slices at 0:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print data[5:10, 0:10]</span>
<span class="out">[[ 0.  0.  1.  2.  2.  4.  2.  1.  6.  4.]
 [ 0.  0.  2.  2.  4.  2.  2.  5.  5.  8.]
 [ 0.  0.  1.  2.  3.  1.  2.  3.  5.  3.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  3.  1.  5.  6.  5.  5.  8.]
 [ 0.  1.  1.  2.  1.  3.  5.  3.  5.  8.]]</span></pre>

    <p>and we don't have to take all the values in the slice&mdash;if we provide a
      <a href="#gloss:stride">stride</a>,
      Python takes values spaced that far apart:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print data[0:10:3, 0:10:2]</span>
<span class="out">[[ 0.  1.  1.  4.  8.]
 [ 0.  2.  4.  2.  6.]
 [ 0.  2.  4.  2.  5.]
 [ 0.  1.  1.  5.  5.]]</span></pre>

    <p>Here,
      we have taken rows 0, 3, 6, and 9,
      and columns 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
      (Again, we always include the lower bound,
      but stop when we reach or cross the upper bound.)</p>

    <p>We also don't have to include the upper and lower bound on the slice.
      If we don't include the lower bound,
      Python uses 0 by default;
      if we don't include the upper,
      the slice runs to the end of the axis,
      and if we don't include either
      (i.e., if we just use ':' on its own),
      the slice includes everything:</p>

<pre><span class="in">small = data[:3, 36:]
print 'small is:'
print small</span>
<span class="out">small is:
[[ 2.  3.  0.  0.]
 [ 1.  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 2.  2.  1.  1.]]</span></pre>

    <p>Arrays also know how to perform common mathematical operations on their values.
      If we want to find the average inflammation for all patients on all days,
      for example,
      we can just ask the array for its mean value</p>

<pre><span class="in">print data.mean()</span>
<span class="out">6.14875</span></pre>

    <p><code>mean</code> is a <a href="#gloss:method">method</a> of the array,
      i.e.,
      a function that belongs to it
      in the same way that the member <code>shape</code> does.
      If values are nouns, methods are verbs:
      they are what the thing in question knows how to do.</p>

    <p>NumPy arrays have lots of useful methods:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'maximum inflammation:', data.max()
print 'minimum inflammation:', data.min()
print 'standard deviation:', data.std()</span>
<span class="out">maximum inflammation: 20.0
minimum inflammation: 0.0
standard deviation: 4.61383319712</span></pre>

    <p>When analyzing data,
      though,
      we often want to look at partial statistics,
      such as the maximum value per patient
      or the average value per day.
      One way to do this is to select the data we want to create a new temporary
      array,
      then ask it to do the calculation:</p>

<pre><span class="in">patient_0 = data[0, :] # 0 on the first axis, everything on the second
print 'maximum inflammation for patient 0:', patient_0.max()</span>
<span class="out">maximum inflammation for patient 0: 18.0</span></pre>

    <p>We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own.
      Instead, we can combine the selection and the method call:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'maximum inflammation for patient 2:', data[2, :].max()</span>
<span class="out">maximum inflammation for patient 2: 19.0</span></pre>

    <p>What if we need the maximum inflammation for <em>all</em> patients,
      or the average for each day?
      As the diagram below shows,
      we want to perform the operation across an axis:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-operations-across-axes.svg" alt="Operations Across Axes" /></p>

    <p>To support this,
      most array methods allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
      If we ask for the average across axis 0,
      we get:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print data.mean(axis=0)</span>
<span class="out">[  0.           0.45         1.11666667   1.75         2.43333333   3.15
   3.8          3.88333333   5.23333333   5.51666667   5.95         5.9
   8.35         7.73333333   8.36666667   9.5          9.58333333
  10.63333333  11.56666667  12.35        13.25        11.96666667
  11.03333333  10.16666667  10.           8.66666667   9.15         7.25
   7.33333333   6.58333333   6.06666667   5.95         5.11666667   3.6
   3.3          3.56666667   2.48333333   1.5          1.13333333
   0.56666667]</span></pre>

    <p>As a quick check,
      we can ask this array what its shape is:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print data.mean(axis=0).shape</span>
<span class="out">(40,)</span></pre>

    <p>The expression <code>(40,)</code> tells us we have an N&times;1 vector,
      so this is the average inflammation per day for all patients.
      If we average across axis 1, we get:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print data.mean(axis=1)</span>
<span class="out">[ 5.45   5.425  6.1    5.9    5.55   6.225  5.975  6.65   6.625  6.525
  6.775  5.8    6.225  5.75   5.225  6.3    6.55   5.7    5.85   6.55
  5.775  5.825  6.175  6.1    5.8    6.425  6.05   6.025  6.175  6.55
  6.175  6.35   6.725  6.125  7.075  5.725  5.925  6.15   6.075  5.75
  5.975  5.725  6.3    5.9    6.75   5.925  7.225  6.15   5.95   6.275  5.7
  6.1    6.825  5.975  6.725  5.7    6.25   6.4    7.05   5.9  ]</span></pre>

    <p>which is the average inflammation per patient across all days.</p>

    <h3>Plotting</h3>

    <p>The mathematician Richard Hamming once said,
      "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers,"
      and the best way to develop insight is often to visualize data.
      Visualization deserves an entire lecture (or course) of its own,
      but we can explore a few features of Python's <code>matplotlib</code> here.
      First,
      let's tell the IPython Notebook that we want our plots displayed inline,
      rather than in a separate viewing window:</p>

    <p>We import the <code>pyplot</code> module from <code>matplotlib</code>
      and use two of its functions to create and display a heat map of our data:</p>

<pre><span class="in">from matplotlib import pyplot
pyplot.imshow(data)
pyplot.show()</span></pre>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/initial-heat-map.png" alt="Initial Heat Map" /></p>

    <p>Blue regions in this heat map are low values, while red shows high values.
      As we can see,
      inflammation rises and falls over a 40-day period.
      Let's take a look at the average inflammation over time:</p>

<pre><span class="in">ave_inflammation = data.mean(axis=0)
pyplot.plot(ave_inflammation)
pyplot.show()</span></pre>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/ave-inflammation-over-time.png" alt="Average Inflammation Over Time" /></p>

    <p>Here,
      we have put the average per day across all patients in the variable
      <code>ave_inflammation</code>,
      then asked <code>pyplot</code> to create and display a line graph of those values.
      The result is roughly a linear rise and fall,
      which is suspicious:
      based on other studies,
      we expect a sharper rise and slower fall.
      Let's have a look at two other statistics:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'maximum inflammation per day'
pyplot.plot(data.max(axis=0))
pyplot.show()

print 'minimum inflammation per day'
pyplot.plot(data.min(axis=0))
pyplot.show()</span></pre>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/max-inflammation-over-time.png" alt="Maximum Inflammation per Day" /></p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/min-inflammation-over-time.png" alt="Minimum Inflammation per Day" /></p>

    <p>The maximum value rises and falls perfectly smoothly,
      while the minimum seems to be a step function.
      Neither result seems particularly likely,
      so either there's a mistake in our calculations
      or something is wrong with our data.</p>

    <h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

    <p>It's very common to create an <a href="#gloss:alias-library">alias</a> for a
      library when importing it
      in order to reduce the amount of typing we have to do.
      Here are our three plots side by side using aliases for <code>numpy</code> and <code>pyplot</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

data = np.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')

plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
plt.ylabel('average')
plt.plot(data.mean(0))

plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
plt.ylabel('max')
plt.plot(data.max(0))

plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
plt.ylabel('min')
plt.plot(data.min(0))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()</span></pre>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/combined-inflammation-per-day.png" alt="Combined Inflammation per Day" /></p>

    <p>The first two lines re-load our libraries as <code>np</code> and <code>plt</code>,
      which are the aliases most Python programmers use.
      The call to <code>loadtxt</code> reads our data,
      and the rest of the program tells the plotting library
      how large we want the figure to be,
      that we're creating three sub-plots,
      what to draw for each one,
      and that we want a tight layout.
      (Perversely,
      if we leave out that call on line 20,
      the layout will actually be squeezed more than with it.)</p>

    <h2>Creating Functions</h2>

    <p>If we only had one data set to analyze,
      it would probably be faster to load the file into a spreadsheet
      and use that to plot some simple statistics.
      But we have twelve files to check,
      and may have more in future.
      In this lesson,
      we'll learn how to write a function
      so that we can repeat several operations with a single command.</p>

    <div class="objectives">
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Define a function that takes parameters.</li>
        <li>Return a value from a function.</li>
        <li>Explain what a call stack is, and trace changes to the call stack as functions are called.</li>
        <li>Set default values for function parameters.</li>
        <li>Explain why we should divide programs into small, single-purpose functions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Defining a Function</h3>

    <p>Let's start by definition a function <code>fahr_to_kelvin</code> that converts temperatures
      from Fahrenheit to Kelvin:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def fahr_to_kelvin(temp):
    return ((temp - 32.0) * (5.0/9.0)) + 273.15</span></pre>

    <p>The definition opens with the word <code>def</code>,
      which is followed by the name of the function
      and a parenthesized list of parameter names.
      When we call the function,
      the values we pass to it are assigned to those variables
      so that we can use them inside the function.
      Inside the function,
      we use a <a href="#gloss:return-statement">return statement</a> to send a result
      back to whoever asked for it.</p>

    <p>Let's try running our function:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'freezing point of water:', fahr_to_kelvin(32)
print 'boiling point of water:', fahr_to_kelvin(212)</span>
<span class="out">freezing point of water: 273.15
boiling point of water: 373.15</span></pre>

    <p>That looks right, but why did we write <code>5.0/9.0</code> instead of <code>5/9</code>?
      Let's try re-defining the function to use the simpler expression:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def fahr_to_kelvin_2(temp):
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9)) + 273.15

print 'freezing point of water:', fahr_to_kelvin_2(32)
print 'boiling point of water:', fahr_to_kelvin_2(212)</span>
<span class="out">freezing point of water: 273.15
boiling point of water: 273.15</span></pre>

    <p>The freezing point is right,
      but the boiling point is wrong.
      Here's the reason:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print '5.0/9.0 is:', 5.0/9.0
print 'but 5/9 is:', 5/9</span>
<span class="out">5.0/9.0 is: 0.555555555556
but 5/9 is: 0</span></pre>

    <p>Computers store numbers in one of two ways:
      as <a href="#gloss:integer">integers</a>
      or as <a href="#gloss:float">floating-point numbers</a> (or floats).
      The first are the numbers we usually count with;
      the second have fractional parts.
      Addition, subtraction and multiplication work on both as we'd expect,
      but division works differently.
      If we divide one integer by another,
      we get the quotient without the remainder:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print '10/3 is:', 10/3</span>
<span class="out">10/3 is: 3</span></pre>

    <p>If either part of the division is a float,
      on the other hand,
      the computer creates a floating-point answer:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print '10.0/3 is:', 10.0/3</span>
<span class="out">10.0/3 is: 3.33333333333</span></pre>

    <p>The computer does this for historical reasons:
      integer operations were much faster on early machines,
      and this behavior is actually useful in a lot of situations.
      It's still confusing,
      though,
      so Python 3 produces a floating-point answer when dividing integers if it needs
      to.
      We're still using Python 2.7 in this class,
      though,
      so if we want 5/9 to give us the right answer,
      we have to write it as 5.0/9, 5/9.0, or some other variation.</p>

    <p>Back to defining functions...
      Now that we've seen how to turn Fahrenheit into Kelvin,
      it's easy to turn Kelvin into Celsius:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def kelvin_to_celsius(temp):
    return temp - 273.15

print 'absolute zero in Celsius:', kelvin_to_celsius(0.0)</span>
<span class="out">absolute zero in Celsius: -273.15</span></pre>

    <p>What about converting Fahrenheit to Celsius?
      We could write out the formula,
      but we don't need to.
      Instead,
      we can <a href="#gloss:function-composition">compose</a> the two functions we
      have already created:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    temp_k = fahr_to_kelvin(temp)
    result = kelvin_to_celsius(temp_k)
    return result

print 'freezing point of water in Celsius:', fahr_to_celsius(32.0)</span>
<span class="out">freezing point of water in Celsius: 0.0</span></pre>

    <p>This is our first taste of how larger programs are built:
      we define basic operations,
      then combine them in ever-large chunks to get the effect we want.</p>

    <h3>The Call Stack</h3>

    <p>Let's take a closer look at what happens when we call <code>fahr_to_celsius(32.0)</code>.
      To make things clearer,
      we'll start by putting the initial value 32.0 in a variable
      and store the final result in one as well:</p>

<pre><span class="in">original = 32.0
final = fahr_to_celsius(original)</span></pre>

    <p>The diagram below shows what memory looks like after the first line has been
      executed:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-call-stack-01.svg" alt="Call Stack (Initial State)" /></p>

    <p>When we call <code>fahr_to_celsius</code>,
      Python <em>doesn't</em> create the variable <code>temp</code> right away.
      Instead,
      it creates something called a <a href="#gloss:stack-frame">stack frame</a>
      to keep track of the variables defined by <code>fahr_to_kelvin</code>.
      Initially,
      this stack frame only holds the value of <code>temp</code>:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-call-stack-02.svg" alt="Call Stack Immediately After First Function Call" /></p>

    <p>When we call <code>fahr_to_kelvin</code> inside <code>fahr_to_celsius</code>,
      Python creates another stack frame to hold <code>fahr_to_kelvin</code>'s variables:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-call-stack-03.svg" alt="Call Stack During First Nested Function Call" /></p>

    <p>It does this because there are now two variables in play called <code>temp</code>:
      the parameter to <code>fahr_to_celsius</code>,
      and the parameter to <code>fahr_to_kelvin</code>.
      Having two variables with the same name in the same part of the program would be
      ambiguous,
      so Python (and every other modern programming language) creates a new stack
      frame for each function call
      to keep that function's variables separate from those defined by other
      functions.</p>

    <p>When the call to <code>fahr_to_kelvin</code> returns a value,
      Python throws away <code>fahr_to_kelvin</code>'s stack frame
      and creates a new variable in the stack frame for <code>fahr_to_celsius</code> to hold the
      temperature in Kelvin:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-call-stack-04.svg" alt="Call Stack After Return From First Nested Function Call" /></p>

    <p>It then calls <code>kelvin_to_celsius</code>,
      which means it creates a stack frame to hold that function's variables:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-call-stack-05.svg" alt="Call Stack During Call to Second Nested Function" /></p>

    <p>Once again,
      Python throws away that stack frame when <code>kelvin_to_celsius</code> is done
      and creates the variable <code>result</code> in the stack frame for <code>fahr_to_celsius</code>:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-call-stack-06.svg" alt="Call Stack After Second Nested Function Returns" /></p>

    <p>Finally,
      when <code>fahr_to_celsius</code> is done,
      Python throws away <em>its</em> stack frame
      and puts its result in a new variable called <code>final</code>
      that lives in the stack frame we started with:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-call-stack-07.svg" alt="Call Stack After All Functions Have Finished" /></p>

    <p>This final stack frame is always there;
      it holds the variables we defined outside the functions in our code.
      What it <em>doesn't</em> hold is the variables that were in the various stack frames.
      If we try to get the value of <code>temp</code> after our functions have finished running,
      Python tells us that there's no such thing:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'final value of temp after all function calls:', temp</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-10-ffd9b4dbd5f1&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 print 'final value of temp after all function calls:', temp

NameError: name 'temp' is not defined</span>

<span class="out">final value of temp after all function calls:</span></pre>

    <p>Why go to all this trouble?
      Well,
      here's a function called <code>span</code> that calculates the difference between
      the minimum and maximum values in an array:</p>

<pre><span class="in">import numpy

def span(a):
    diff = a.max() - a.min()
    return diff

data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
print 'span of data', span(data)</span>
<span class="out">span of data 20.0</span></pre>

    <p>Notice that <code>span</code> assigns a value to a variable called <code>diff</code>.
      We might very well use a variable with the same name to hold data:</p>

<pre><span class="in">diff = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
print 'span of data:', span(diff)</span>
<span class="out">span of data: 20.0</span></pre>

    <p>We don't expect <code>diff</code> to have the value 20.0 after this function call,
      so the name <code>diff</code> cannot refer to the same thing inside <code>span</code> as it does in
      the main body of our program.
      And yes,
      we could probably choose a different name than <code>diff</code> in our main program in
      this case,
      but we don't want to have to read every line of NumPy to see what variable names
      its functions use
      before calling any of those functions,
      just in case they change the values of our variables.</p>

    <p>The big idea here is <a href="#gloss:encapsulation">encapsulation</a>,
      and it's the key to writing correct, comprehensible programs.
      A function's job is to turns several operations into one
      so that we can think about a single function call
      instead of a dozen or a hundred statements
      each time we want to do something.
      That only works if functions don't interfere with each other;
      if they do,
      we have to pay attention to the details once again,
      which quickly overloads our short-term memory.</p>

    <h3>Testing and Documenting</h3>

    <p>Once we start putting things in functions so that we can re-use them,
      we need to start testing that those functions are working correctly.
      To see how to do this,
      let's write a function to center a dataset around a particular value:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def center(data, desired):
    return (data - data.mean()) + desired</span></pre>

    <p>We could test this on our actual data,
      but since we don't know what the values ought to be,
      it will be hard to tell if the result was correct.
      Instead,
      let's use NumPy to create a matrix of 0's
      and then center that around 3:</p>

<pre><span class="in">z = numpy.zeros((2,2))
print center(z, 3)</span>
<span class="out">[[ 3.  3.]
 [ 3.  3.]]</span></pre>

    <p>That looks right,
      so let's try center our real data:</p>

<pre><span class="in">data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
print center(data, 0)</span>
<span class="out">[[-6.14875 -6.14875 -5.14875 ..., -3.14875 -6.14875 -6.14875]
 [-6.14875 -5.14875 -4.14875 ..., -5.14875 -6.14875 -5.14875]
 [-6.14875 -5.14875 -5.14875 ..., -4.14875 -5.14875 -5.14875]
 ...,
 [-6.14875 -5.14875 -5.14875 ..., -5.14875 -5.14875 -5.14875]
 [-6.14875 -6.14875 -6.14875 ..., -6.14875 -4.14875 -6.14875]
 [-6.14875 -6.14875 -5.14875 ..., -5.14875 -5.14875 -6.14875]]</span></pre>

    <p>It's hard to tell from the default output whether the result is correct,
      but there are a few simple tests that will reassure us:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'original min, mean, and max are:', data.min(), data.mean(), data.max()
centered = center(data, 0)
print 'min, mean, and and max of centered data are:', centered.min(), centered.mean(), centered.max()</span>
<span class="out">original min, mean, and max are: 0.0 6.14875 20.0
min, mean, and and max of centered data are: -6.14875 -3.49054118942e-15 13.85125</span></pre>

    <p>That seems almost right:
      the original mean was about 6.1,
      so the lower bound from zero is how about -6.1.
      The mean of the centered data isn't quite zero&mdash;we'll explore why not in
      the challenges&mdash;but it's pretty close.
      We can even go further and check that the standard deviation hasn't changed:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'std dev before and after:', data.std(), centered.std()</span>
<span class="out">std dev before and after: 4.61383319712 4.61383319712</span></pre>

    <p>Those values look the same,
      but we probably wouldn't notice if they were different in the sixth decimal
      place.
      Let's do this instead:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'difference in standard deviations before and after:', data.std() - centered.std()</span>
<span class="out">difference in standard deviations before and after: -3.5527136788e-15</span></pre>

    <p>Again,
      the difference is very small.
      It's still possible that our function is wrong,
      but it seems unlikely enough that we should probably get back to doing our
      analysis.
      We have one more task first, though:
      we should write some <a href="#gloss:documentation">documentation</a> for our
      function
      to remind ourselves later what it's for and how to use it.</p>

    <p>The usual way to put documentation in software is to add
      <a href="#gloss:comment">comments</a> like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in"># center(data, desired): return a new array containing the original data centered around the desired value.
def center(data, desired):
    return (data - data.mean()) + desired</span></pre>

    <p>There's a better way, though.
      If the first thing in a function is a string that isn't assigned to a variable,
      that string is attached to the function as its documentation:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def center(data, desired):
    'Return a new array containing the original data centered around the desired value.'
    return (data - data.mean()) + desired</span></pre>

    <p>This is better because we can now ask Python's built-in help system to show us
      the documentation for the function:</p>

<pre><span class="in">help(center)</span>
<span class="out">Help on function center in module __main__:

center(data, desired)
    Return a new array containing the original data centered around the desired value.</span></pre>

    <p>A string like this is called a <a href="#gloss:docstring">docstring</a>.
      If we need to write it,
      or any other string,
      on multiple lines,
      we can do so by starting and ending with three quote characters instead of one:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def center(data, desired):
    '''Return a new array containing the original data centered around the desired value.
    Example: center([1, 2, 3], 0) =&gt; [-1, 0, 1]'''
    return (data - data.mean()) + desired

help(center)</span>
<span class="out">Help on function center in module __main__:

center(data, desired)
    Return a new array containing the original data centered around the desired value.
    Example: center([1, 2, 3], 0) =&gt; [-1, 0, 1]</span></pre>

    <h3>Defining Defaults</h3>

    <p>We have passed parameters to functions in two ways:
      directly, as in <code>span(data)</code>,
      and by name, as in <code>numpy.loadtxt(fname='something.csv', delimiter=',')</code>.
      In fact,
      we can pass the filename to <code>loadtxt</code> without the <code>fname=</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">numpy.loadtxt('inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')</span>
<span class="out">array([[ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  3.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  2., ...,  1.,  0.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  2.,  1.,  1.],
       ...,
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  2.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  0.]])</span></pre>

    <p>but we still need to say <code>delimiter=</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">numpy.loadtxt('inflammation-01.csv', ',')</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-24-e3bc6cf4fd6a&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()

    775     try:
    776         # Make sure we're dealing with a proper dtype
--&gt; 777         dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
    778         defconv = _getconv(dtype)
    779

TypeError: data type "," not understood</span></pre>

    <p>To understand what's going on,
      and make our own functions easier to use,
      let's re-define our <code>center</code> function like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def center(data, desired=0.0):
    '''Return a new array containing the original data centered around the desired value (0 by default).
    Example: center([1, 2, 3], 0) =&gt; [-1, 0, 1]'''
    return (data - data.mean()) + desired</span></pre>

    <p>The key change is that the second parameter is now written <code>desired=0.0</code> instead
      of just <code>desired</code>.
      If we call the function with two arguments,
      it works as it did before:</p>

<pre><span class="in">test_data = numpy.zeros((2, 2))
print center(test_data, 3)</span>
<span class="out">[[ 3.  3.]
 [ 3.  3.]]</span></pre>

    <p>But we can also now call it with just one parameter,
      in which case <code>desired</code> is automatically assigned the
      <a href="#gloss:default-parameter-value">default value</a> of 0.0:</p>

<pre><span class="in">more_data = 5 + numpy.zeros((2, 2))
print 'data before centering:', more_data
print 'centered data:', center(more_data)</span>
<span class="out">data before centering: [[ 5.  5.]
 [ 5.  5.]]
centered data: [[ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]]</span></pre>

    <p>This is handy:
      if we usually want a function to work one way,
      but occasionally need it to do something else,
      we can allow people to pass a parameter when they need to
      but provide a default to make the normal case easier.
      The example below shows how Python matches values to parameters:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def display(a=1, b=2, c=3):
    print 'a:', a, 'b:', b, 'c:', c

print 'no parameters:'
display()
print 'one parameter:'
display(55)
print 'two parameters:'
display(55, 66)</span>
<span class="out">no parameters:
a: 1 b: 2 c: 3
one parameter:
a: 55 b: 2 c: 3
two parameters:
a: 55 b: 66 c: 3</span></pre>

    <p>As this example shows,
      parameters are matched up from left to right,
      and any that haven't been given a value explicitly get their default value.
      We can override this behavior by naming the value as we pass it in:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'only setting the value of c'
display(c=77)</span>
<span class="out">only setting the value of c
a: 1 b: 2 c: 77</span></pre>

    <p>With that in hand,
      let's look at the help for <code>numpy.loadtxt</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">help(numpy.loadtxt)</span>
<span class="out">Help on function loadtxt in module numpy.lib.npyio:

loadtxt(fname, dtype=&lt;type 'float'&gt;, comments='#', delimiter=None, converters=None, skiprows=0,
        usecols=None, unpack=False, ndmin=0)
    Load data from a text file.

    Each row in the text file must have the same number of values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : file or str
        File, filename, or generator to read.  If the filename extension is
        <code>.gz</code> or <code>.bz2</code>, the file is first decompressed. Note that
        generators should return byte strings for Python 3k.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the resulting array; default: float.  If this is a
        record data-type, the resulting array will be 1-dimensional, and
        each row will be interpreted as an element of the array.  In this
        case, the number of columns used must match the number of fields in
        the data-type.
    comments : str, optional
        The character used to indicate the start of a comment;
        default: '#'.
    delimiter : str, optional
        The string used to separate values.  By default, this is any
        whitespace.
    ...</span></pre>

<p>There's a lot of information here,
but the most important part is the first couple of lines:</p>

<pre><span class="in">loadtxt(fname, dtype=&lt;type 'float'&gt;, comments='#', delimiter=None, converters=None,
        skiprows=0, usecols=None, unpack=False, ndmin=0)</span></pre>

    <p>This tells us that <code>loadtxt</code> has one parameter called <code>fname</code> that doesn't have
      a default value,
      and eight others that do.
      If we call the function like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">numpy.loadtxt('inflammation-01.csv', ',')</span></pre>

    <p>then the filename is assigned to <code>fname</code> (which is what we want),
      but the delimiter string <code>','</code> is assigned to <code>dtype</code> rather than <code>delimiter</code>,
      because <code>dtype</code> is the second parameter in the list.
      That's why we don't have to provide <code>fname=</code> for the filename,
      but <em>do</em> have to provide <code>delimiter=</code> for the second parameter.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing Multiple Data Sets</h2>

    <p>We have created a function called <code>analyze</code> that creates graphs of the minimum,

      for a single data set:</p>

<pre><span class="in">import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def analyze(filename):
    data = np.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',')

    plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

    plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
    plt.ylabel('average')
    plt.plot(data.mean(0))

    plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
    plt.ylabel('max')
    plt.plot(data.max(0))

    plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
    plt.ylabel('min')
    plt.plot(data.min(0))

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

analyze('inflammation-01.csv')</span></pre>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/combined-inflammation-per-day.png" alt="Combined Inflammation per Day" /></p>

    <p>We can use it to analyze other data sets one by one:</p>

<pre><span class="in">analyze('inflammation-02.csv')</span></pre>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/combined-inflammation-2.png" alt="Combined Inflammation per Day (Second Data Set)" /></p>

    <p>but we have a dozen data sets right now and more on the way.
      We want to create plots for all our data sets with a single statement.
      To do that,
      we'll have to teach the computer how to repeat things.</p>

    <div class="objectives">

    </div>

    <h3>For Loops</h3>

    <p>Suppose we want to print each character in the word "lead" on a line of its own.
      One way is to use four <code>print</code> statements:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def print_characters(element):
    print element[0]
    print element[1]
    print element[2]
    print element[3]

print_characters('lead')</span>
<span class="out">l
e
a
d</span></pre>

    <p>but that's a bad approach for two reasons:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>It doesn't scale:
          if we want to print the characters in a string that's hundreds of letters
          long,
          we'd be better off just typing them in.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It's fragile:
          if we give it a longer string,
          it only prints part of the data,
          and if we give it a shorter one,
          it produces an error because we're asking for characters that don't exist.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here's a better approach:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def print_characters(element):
    for char in element:
        print char

print_characters('lead')</span>
<span class="out">l
e
a
d</span></pre>

<p>This is shorter&mdash;certainly shorter than something that prints every character
  in a hundred-letter string&mdash;and
  more robust as well:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print_characters('oxygen')</span>
<span class="out">o
x
y
g
e
n</span></pre>

    <p>The improved version of <code>print_characters</code> uses a <a href="#gloss:for-loop">for loop</a>
      to repeat an operation&mdash;in this case, printing&mdash;once for each thing in a
      collection.
      The general form of a loop is:</p>

<pre>
<strong>for</strong> <em>variable</em> <strong>in</strong> <em>collection</em><strong>:</strong>
    <em>do things with variable</em></pre>

    <p>We can call the <a href="#gloss:loop-variable">loop variable</a> anything we
      like,
      but there must be a colon at the end of the line starting the loop,
      and we must indent the <a href="#gloss:loop-body">body</a> of the loop.</p>

    <p>Here's another loop that repeatedly updates a variable:</p>

<pre><span class="in">length = 0
for vowel in 'aeiou':
    length = length + 1
print 'There are', length, 'vowels'</span>
<span class="out">There are 5 vowels</span></pre>

    <p>It's worth tracing the execution of this little program step by step.
      Since there are five characters in <code>'aeiou'</code>,
      the statement on line 3 will be executed five times.
      The first time around,
      <code>length</code> is zero (the value assigned to it on line 1)
      and <code>vowel</code> is <code>'a'</code>.
      The statement adds 1 to the old value of <code>length</code>,
      producing 1,
      and updates <code>length</code> to refer to that new value.
      The next time around,
      <code>vowel</code> is <code>'e'</code> and <code>length</code> is 1,
      so <code>length</code> is updated to be 2.
      After three more updates,
      <code>length</code> is 5;
      since there is nothing left in <code>'aeiou'</code> for Python to process,
      the loop finishes
      and the <code>print</code> statement on line 4 tells us our final answer.</p>

    <p>Note that finding the length of a string is such a common operation
      that Python actually has a built-in function to do it called <code>len</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print len('aeiou')</span>
<span class="out">5</span></pre>

    <p><code>len</code> is much faster than any function we could write ourselves,
      and much easier to read than a two-line loop;
      it will also give us the length of many other things that we haven't met yet,
      so we should always use it when we can.</p>

    <h3>Lists</h3>

    <p>Just as a <code>for</code> loop is a way to do operations many times,
      a list is a way to store many values.
      Unlike NumPy arrays,
      there are built into the language.
      We create a list by putting values inside square brackets:</p>

<pre><span class="in">odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
print 'odds are:', odds</span>
<span class="out">odds are: [1, 3, 5, 7]</span></pre>

    <p>We select individual elements from lists by indexing them:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'first and last:', odds[0], odds[-1]</span>
<span class="out">first and last: 1 7</span></pre>

    <p>and if we loop over a list,
      the loop variable is assigned elements one at a time:</p>

<pre><span class="in">for number in odds:
    print number</span>
<span class="out">1
3
5
7</span></pre>

    <p>There is one important difference between lists and strings:
      we can change the values in a list,
      but we cannot change the characters in a string.
      For example:</p>

<pre><span class="in">names = ['Newton', 'Darwing', 'Turing'] # typo in Darwin's name
print 'names is originally:', names
names[1] = 'Darwin' # correct the name
print 'final value of names:', names</span>
<span class="out">names is originally: ['Newton', 'Darwing', 'Turing']
final value of names: ['Newton', 'Darwin', 'Turing']</span></pre>

    <p>works, but:</p>

<pre><span class="in">name = 'Bell'
name[0] = 'b'</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-12-220df48aeb2e&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
      1 name = 'Bell'
----&gt; 2 name[0] = 'b'

TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment</span></pre>

    <p>does not.
      A value that can be changed is called <a href="#gloss:mutable">mutable</a>,
      while one that cannot be is called <a href="#gloss:immutable">immutable</a>.
      There are many ways to change the values in lists besides assigning to elements:</p>

<pre><span class="in">odds.append(11)
print 'odds after adding a value:', odds</span>
<span class="out">odds after adding a value: [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]</span>
<span class="in">del odds[0]
print 'odds after removing the first element:', odds</span>
<span class="out">odds after removing the first element: [3, 5, 7, 11]</span>
<span class="in">odds.reverse()
print 'odds after reversing:', odds</span>
<span class="out">odds after reversing: [11, 7, 5, 3]</span></pre>

    <h3>Processing Multiple Files</h3>

    <p>We now have almost everything we need to process all our data files.
      The only thing that's missing is a library with a rather unpleasant name:</p>

<pre><span class="in">import glob</span></pre>

    <p>The <code>glob</code> library contains a single function, also called <code>glob</code>,
      that finds files whose names match a pattern.
      We provide those patterns as strings:
      the character <code>*</code> matches zero or more characters,
      while <code>?</code> matches any one character.
      We can use this to get the names of all the IPython Notebooks we have created so
      far:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print glob.glob('*.ipynb')</span></pre>

    <p>or to get the names of all our CSV data files:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print glob.glob('*.csv')</span></pre>

    <p>As these examples show,
      <code>glob.glob</code>'s result is a list of strings,
      which means we can loop over it
      to do something with each filename in turn.
      In our case,
      the "something" we want is our <code>analyze</code> function.
      Let's test it by analyzing the first three files in the list:</p>

<pre><span class="in">filenames = glob.glob('*.csv')
filenames = filenames[0:3]
for f in filenames:
    print f
    analyze(f)</span></pre>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/loop-inflammation-01.png" alt="Inflammation (Data Set 1)" /></p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/loop-inflammation-02.png" alt="Inflammation (Data Set 2)" /></p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/loop-inflammation-03.png" alt="Inflammation (Data Set 3)" /></p>

    <p>Sure enough,
      the maxima of these data sets show exactly the same ramp as the first,
      and their minima show the same staircase structure.</p>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Python has a built-in function called <code>range</code> that creates a list of
          numbers:
          <code>range(3)</code> produces <code>[0, 1, 2]</code>, <code>range(2, 5)</code> produces <code>[2, 3, 4]</code>, and
          <code>range(2, 10, 3)</code> produces <code>[2, 5, 8]</code>.
          Using <code>range</code>,
          write a function that prints the <em>N</em> natural numbers:
<pre><span class="in">print_N(3)</span>
<span class="out">1
2
3</span></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Exponentiation is built into Python:
<pre><span class="in">print 2**4</span>
<span class="out">16</span></pre>
          It also has a function called <code>pow</code> that calculates the same value.
          Write a function called <code>expo</code> that uses a loop to calculate the same result.
        </li>
        <li>
          Python's strings have methods, just like NumPy's arrays.
          One of these is called <code>reverse</code>:
<pre><span class="in">print 'Newton'.reverse()</span>
<span class="out">notweN</span></pre>
          Write a function called <code>rev</code> that does the same thing:
<pre><span class="in">print rev('Newton')</span>
<span class="out">notweN</span></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Write a function called <code>total</code> that calculates the sum of the values in a list.
          (Python has a built-in function called <code>sum</code> that does this for you.
          Please don't use it for this exercise.)</li>
        <li>Write a function called <code>analyze_all</code> that takes a filename pattern as its
          sole argument
          and runs <code>analyze</code> for each file whose name matches the pattern.</li>

    <h2>Making Choices</h2>

    <p>Our previous lessons have shown us how to manipulate data,
      define our own functions,
      and repeat things.
      However,
      the programs we have written so far always do the same things,
      regardless of what data they're given.
      We want programs to make choices based on the values they are manipulating.
      To help us see what decisions they're making,
      we'll start by looking at how computers manipulate images.</p>

    <div class="objectives">

    </div>

    <h3>Image Grids</h3>

    <p>Let's start by creating some simple heat maps of our own
      using a library called <code>ipythonblocks</code>.
      The first step is to create our own "image":</p>

<pre><span class="in">from ipythonblocks import ImageGrid

grid = ImageGrid(5, 3)
grid.show()</span></pre>

<table class="blockgrid"><tbody><tr><td title="Index: [0, 2]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [1, 2]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [2, 2]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [3, 2]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [4, 2]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td></tr><tr><td title="Index: [0, 1]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [1, 1]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [2, 1]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [3, 1]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [4, 1]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td></tr><tr><td title="Index: [0, 0]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [1, 0]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [2, 0]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [3, 0]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [4, 0]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td></tr></tbody></table>

    <p>Just like a NumPy array,
      an <code>ImageGrid</code> has some properties that hold information about it:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'grid width:', grid.width
print 'grid height:', grid.height
print 'grid lines on:', grid.lines_on</span>
<span class="out">grid width: 5
grid height: 3
grid lines on: True</span></pre>

    <p>The obvious thing to do with a grid like this is color in its cells,
      but in order to do that,
      we need to know how computers represent color.
      The most common schemes are <a href="#gloss:rgb">RGB</a>,
      which is short for "red, green, blue".
      RGB is an <a href="#gloss:additive-color-model">additive color model</a>:
      every shade is some combination of red, green, and blue intensities.
      We can think of these three values as being the axes in a cube:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/color-cube.png" alt="RGB Color Cube" /></p>

    <p>An RGB color is an example of a multi-part value:
      like a Cartesian coordinate,
      it is one thing with several parts.
      We can represent such a value in Python using a <a href="#gloss:tuple">tuple</a>,
      which we write using parentheses instead of the square brackets used for a list:</p>

<pre><span class="in">position = (12.3, 45.6)
print 'position is:', position
color = (10, 20, 30)
print 'color is:', color</span>
<span class="out">position is: (12.3, 45.6)
color is: (10, 20, 30)</span></pre>

    <p>We can select elements from tuples using indexing,
      just as we do with lists and arrays:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print 'first element of color is:', color[0]</span>
<span class="out">first element of color is: 10</span></pre>

    <p>Unlike lists and arrays,
      though,
      tuples cannot be changed after they are created&mdash;in technical terms,
      they are <a href="#gloss:immutable">immutable</a>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">color[0] = 40
print 'first element of color after change:', color[0]</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-7-9c3dd30a4e52&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 color[0] = 40
      2 print 'first element of color after change:', color[0]

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment</span></pre>

    <p>If a tuple represents an RGB color,
      its red, green, and blue components can take on values between 0 and 255.
      The upper bound may seem odd,
      but it's the largest number that can be represented in an 8-bit byte
      (i.e., 2<sup>8</sup>-1).
      This makes it easy for computers to manipulate colors,
      while providing fine enough gradations to fool most human eyes,
      most of the time.</p>

    <p>Let's see what a few RGB colors actually look like:</p>

<pre><span class="in">row = ImageGrid(8, 1)
row[0, 0] = (0, 0, 0)   # no color =&gt; black
row[1, 0] = (255, 0, 0) # all red
row[2, 0] = (0, 255, 0) # all green
row[3, 0] = (0, 0, 255) # all blue
row[4, 0] = (255, 255, 0) # red and green
row[5, 0] = (255, 0, 255) # red and blue
row[6, 0] = (0, 255, 255) # green and blue
row[7, 0] = (255, 255, 255) # all colors =&gt; white
row.show()</span></pre>

<table class="blockgrid"><tbody><tr><td title="Index: [0, 0]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [1, 0]&#10;Color: (255, 0, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [2, 0]&#10;Color: (0, 255, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [3, 0]&#10;Color: (0, 0, 255)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"></td><td title="Index: [4, 0]&#10;Color: (255, 255, 0)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"></td><td title="Index: [5, 0]&#10;Color: (255, 0, 255)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"></td><td title="Index: [6, 0]&#10;Color: (0, 255, 255)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(0, 255, 255);"></td><td title="Index: [7, 0]&#10;Color: (255, 255, 255)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"></td></tr></tbody></table>

    <p>(It's hard to see the last cell because it's white on white,
      but it's there.)</p>

    <p>Simple color values like <code>(0,255,0)</code> are easy enough to decipher with a bit of
      practice,
      but what color is <code>(214,90,127)</code>?
      To help us,
      <code>ipythonblocks</code> provides a function called <code>show_color</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">from ipythonblocks import show_color
show_color(214, 90, 127)</span></pre>

<table><tr><td style="width: 120px; height: 20px; background-color: rgb(214, 90, 127);"></td></tr></table>

    <p>It also provides a table of standard colors:</p>

<pre><span class="in">from ipythonblocks import colors
c = ImageGrid(3, 2)
c[0, 0] = colors['Fuchsia']
c[0, 1] = colors['Salmon']
c[1, 0] = colors['Orchid']
c[1, 1] = colors['Lavender']
c[2, 0] = colors['LimeGreen']
c[2, 1] = colors['HotPink']
c.show()</span></pre>

<table class="blockgrid"><tbody><tr><td title="Index: [0, 1]&#10;Color: (250, 128, 114)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(250, 128, 114);"></td><td title="Index: [1, 1]&#10;Color: (230, 230, 250)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(230, 230, 250);"></td><td title="Index: [2, 1]&#10;Color: (255, 105, 180)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(255, 105, 180);"></td></tr><tr><td title="Index: [0, 0]&#10;Color: (255, 0, 255)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"></td><td title="Index: [1, 0]&#10;Color: (218, 112, 214)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(218, 112, 214);"></td><td title="Index: [2, 0]&#10;Color: (50, 205, 50)" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;background-color: rgb(50, 205, 50);"></td></tr></tbody></table>

    <h3>Conditionals</h3>

    <p>The other thing we need in order to create a heat map of our own
      is a way to pick a color based on a data value.
      The tool Python gives us for doing this is called a <a href="#gloss:conditional-statement">conditional
        statement</a>,
      and looks like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">num = 37
if num &gt; 100:
    print 'greater'
else:
    print 'not greater'
print 'done'</span>
<span class="out">not greater
done</span></pre>

    <p>The second line of this code uses the keyword <code>if</code> to tell Python that we want
      to make a choice.
      If the test that follows it is true,
      the body of the <code>if</code>
      (i.e., the lines indented underneath it) are executed.
      If the test is false,
      the body of the <code>else</code> is executed instead.
      Only one or the other is ever executed:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-flowchart-conditional.svg" alt="Executing a Conditional" /></p>

    <p>Conditional statements don't have to include an <code>else</code>.
      If there isn't one,
      Python simply does nothing if the test is false:</p>

<pre><span class="in">num = 53
print 'before conditional...'
if num &gt; 100:
    print '53 is greater than 100'
print '...after conditional'</span>
<span class="out">before conditional...
...after conditional</span></pre>

    <p>We can also chain several tests together using <code>elif</code>,
      which is short for "else if".
      This makes it simple to write a function that returns the sign of a number:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def sign(num):
    if num &gt; 0:
        return 1
    elif num == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return -1

print 'sign of -3:', sign(-3)</span>
<span class="out">sign of -3: -1</span></pre>

    <p>One important thing to notice the code above is that we use a double equals sign
      <code>==</code> to test for equality
      rather than a single equals sign
      because the latter is used to mean assignment.
      This convention was inherited from C,
      and while many other programming languages work the same way,
      it does take a bit of getting used to...</p>

    <p>We can also combine tests using <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>.
      <code>and</code> is only true if both parts are true:</p>

<pre><span class="in">if (1 &gt; 0) and (-1 &gt; 0):
    print 'both parts are true'
else:
    print 'one part is not true'</span>
<span class="out">one part is not true</span></pre>

    <p>while <code>or</code> is true if either part is true:</p>

<pre><span class="in">if (1 &lt; 0) or ('left' &lt; 'right'):
    print 'at least one test is true'</span>
<span class="out">at least one test is true</span></pre>

    <p>In this case,
      "either" means "either or both", not "either one or the other but not both".</p>

    <h3>Nesting</h3>

    <p>Another thing to realize is that <code>if</code> statements can be combined with loops
      just as easily as they can be combined with functions.
      For example,
      if we want to sum the positive numbers in a list,
      we can write this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">numbers = [-5, 3, 2, -1, 9, 6]
total = 0
for n in numbers:
    if n &gt;= 0:
        total = total + n
print 'sum of positive values:', total</span>
<span class="out">sum of positive values: 20</span></pre>

    <p>We could equally well calculate the positive and negative sums in a single loop:</p>

<pre><span class="in">pos_total = 0
neg_total = 0
for n in numbers:
    if n &gt;= 0:
        pos_total = pos_total + n
    else:
        neg_total = neg_total + n
print 'negative and positive sums are:', neg_total, pos_total</span>
<span class="out">negative and positive sums are: -6 20</span></pre>

    <p>We can even put one loop inside another:</p>

<pre><span class="in">for consonant in 'bcd':
    for vowel in 'ae':
        print consonant + vowel</span>
<span class="out">ba
be
ca
ce
da
de</span></pre>

    <p>As the diagram below shows,
      the <a href="#gloss:inner-loop">inner loop</a> runs from start to finish
      each time the <a href="#gloss:outer-loop">outer loop</a> runs once:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-flowchart-nested-loops.svg" alt="Execution of Nested Loops" /></p>

    <p>We can combine nesting and conditionals to create patterns in an image:</p>

<pre><span class="in">square = ImageGrid(5, 5)
for x in range(square.width):
    for y in range(square.height):
        if x &lt; y:
            square[x, y] = colors['Fuchsia']
        elif x == y:
            square[x, y] = colors['Olive']
        else:
            square[x, y] = colors['SlateGray']
square.show()</span></pre>

    <p>This is our first hand-made data visualization:
      the colors show where <code>x</code> is less than, equal to, or greater than <code>y</code>.</p>

    <h3>Creating a Heat Map</h3>

    <p>The last step is to turn our data into something we can see.
      As in previous lessons,
      the first step is to get the data into memory:</p>

<pre><span class="in">import numpy as np
data = np.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
print 'data shape:', data.shape</span>
<span class="out">data shape: (60, 40)</span></pre>

    <p>The second is to create an image grid that is the same size as the data:</p>

<pre><span class="in">width, height = data.shape
heatmap = ImageGrid(width, height)</span></pre>

    <p>(The first line of the code above takes advantage of a neat trick:
      we can unpack the values in a tuple by assigning it to
      as many variables as it has entries.)</p>

    <p>The third step is to decide <em>how</em> we are going to color the cells in the heat
      map.
      To keep things simple,
      we will use red, green, and blue as our colors,
      and compare data values to the data set's mean.
      Here's the code:</p>

<pre><span class="in">for x in range(width):
    for y in range(height):
        if data[x, y] &lt; data.mean():
            heatmap[x, y] = colors['Red']
        elif data[x, y] == data.mean():
            heatmap[x, y] = colors['Green']
        else:
            heatmap[x, y] = colors['Blue']
heatmap.show()</span></pre>

    <p>This may be what we asked for,
      but both the image and the code are hideous:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>It's too large for us to view the whole thing at once on a small laptop screen.</li>
      <li>Our first heatmap had time along the X axis; this seems to have time along the Y axis.</li>
      <li>Red against blue is pretty hard on the eyes.</li>
      <li>The heatmap only shows two colors because none of the (integer) measurements has exactly the same value as the (fractional) mean.</li>
      <li>We are calculating the mean of <code>data</code> either once or twice each time we go through the loop.  That means that on a 40&times;60 data set, we are performing the same calculation 2400 times.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here's how we can improve it:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>We can give <code>ImageGrid</code> an optional parameter <code>block_size</code> to set the size of each block.</li>
      <li>We can transpose our data before creating the grid.</li>
      <li>We can pick better colors (I'm personally fond of orchid, fuchsia, and hot pink).</li>
      <li>Instead of checking if values are exactly equal to the mean, we can see if they are close to it.</li>
      <li>We can calculate the mean once, before we start our loops, and use that value over and over.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Our modified code looks like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">flipped = data.transpose()
width, height = flipped.shape
heatmap = ImageGrid(width, height, block_size=5)
center = flipped.mean()
for x in range(width):
    for y in range(height):
        if flipped[x, y] &lt; (0.8 * center):
            heatmap[x, y] = colors['Orchid']
        elif flipped[x, y] &gt; (1.2 * center):
            heatmap[x, y] = colors['HotPink']
        else:
            heatmap[x, y] = colors['Fuchsia']
heatmap.show()</span></pre>

    <p>That's a bit better&mdash;but now the contrast between the colors isn't great
      enough.
      And there still aren't very many fuchsia cells:
      we may want to widen the band around the mean that gets that color.</p>

    <p>We could rewrite our loop a third time,
      but the right thing to do is to put our code in a function
      so that we can experiment with bands and colors more easily.</p>

<pre><span class="in">def make_heatmap(values, low_color, mid_color, high_color, low_band, high_band, block_size):
    width, height = values.shape
    result = ImageGrid(width, height, block_size=block_size)
    center = values.mean()
    for x in range(width):
        for y in range(height):
            if values[x, y] &lt; low_band * center:
                result[x, y] = low_color
            elif values[x, y] &gt; high_band * center:
                result[x, y] = high_color
            else:
                result[x, y] = mid_color
    return result</span></pre>

    <p>To test this function,
      we'll run it with the settings we just used:</p>

<pre><span class="in">h = make_heatmap(flipped, colors['Orchid'], colors['Fuchsia'], colors['HotPink'], 0.8, 1.2, 5)
h.show()</span></pre>

    <p>We'll probably want to experiment a bit more before publishing,
      but writing a function has made experimenting easy.
      We can make it even easier by re-defining our function one more time
      to give the parameters default values.
      While we're at it,
      let's put the low and high bands at the front,
      since they're more likely to change than our color choices:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def make_heatmap(values,
                 low_band=0.5, high_band=1.5,
                 low_color=colors['Gray'], mid_color=colors['YellowGreen'], high_color=colors['SpringGreen'],
                 block_size=5):
    width, height = values.shape
    result = ImageGrid(width, height, block_size=block_size)
    center = values.mean()
    for x in range(width):
        for y in range(height):
            if values[x, y] &lt; low_band * center:
                result[x, y] = low_color
            elif values[x, y] &gt; high_band * center:
                result[x, y] = high_color
            else:
                result[x, y] = mid_color
    return result</span></pre>

    <p>Once default values are added,
      the function's first line is too long to fit comfortably on our screen.
      Rather than breaking it wherever it hits the right edge of the screen,
      we have divided the parameters into logical groups to make it more readable.</p>

    <p>We can now leave out everything except the data being visualized,
      or provide the data and the bands
      and re-use the default colors and block size:</p>

<pre><span class="in">h = make_heatmap(flipped, 0.5, 1.5, colors['Gray'], colors['YellowGreen'], colors['SpringGreen'], 5)
h.show()</span></pre>

        <li>Specify colors use (red, green, blue) triples, each component of which is an integer in the range 0..255.</li>
        <li>Use <code>if condition</code> to start a conditional statement, <code>elif condition</code> to provide additional tests, and <code>else</code> to provide a default.</li>
        <li>The bodies of the branches of conditional statements must be indented.</li>
        <li>Use <code>==</code> to test for equality.</li>
        <li><code>X and Y</code> is only true if both X and Y are true.</li>
        <li><code>X or Y</code> is true if either X or Y, or both, are true.</li>
        <li>Zero, the empty string, and the empty list are considered false; all other numbers, strings, and lists are considered true.</li>
        <li>Nest loops to operate on multi-dimensional data.</li>
        <li>Put code whose parameters change frequently in a function, then call it with different parameter values to customize its behavior.</li>

          Fill in the <code>____</code> in the code below to create a bar that changes color from
          dark blue to black.
<pre><span class="in">bar = ImageGrid(10, 1)
for x in range(10):
    bar[x, 0] = (0, 0, ____)

          Why do computers use red, green, and blue as their primary colors?

        <li>
          <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> aren't the only values in Python that are true and false.
          In fact, <em>any</em> value can be used in an <code>if</code> or <code>elif</code>.
          After reading and running the code below,
          explain what the rule is for which values are considered true and which are
          considered false.
          (Note that if the body of a conditional is a single statement, we can write
          it on the same line as the <code>if</code>.)
<pre><span class="in">if '': print 'empty string is true'
if 'word': print 'word is true'
if []: print 'empty list is true'
if [1, 2, 3]: print 'non-empty list is true'
if 0: print 'zero is true'
if 1: print 'one is true'</span></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a function called <code>near</code> that returns <code>True</code> if its first parameter is
          within 10% of its second
          and <code>False</code> otherwise.
          Compare your implementation with your partner's:
          do you return the same answer for all possible pairs of numbers?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will changing the nesting of the loops in the code above&mdash;i.e.,
          wrapping the Y-axis loop around the X-axis loop&mdash;change the final
          image?
          Why or why not?
        </li>
        <li>
          Python (and most other languages in the C family) provides <a href="#gloss:in-place-operator">in-place operators</a>
          that work like this:
<pre><span class="in">x = 1  # original value
x += 1 # add one to x, assigning result back to x
x *= 3 # multiply x by 3
print x</span>
<span class="out">6</span></pre>
          Rewrite the code that sums the positive and negative numbers in a list
          using in-place operators.
          Do you think the result is more or less readable than the original?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why did we transpose our data outside our heat map function?
          Why not have the function perform the transpose?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why does the heat map function return the grid rather than displaying it
          immediately?
          Do you think this is a good or bad design choice?
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain what the overall effect of this code is:
<pre><span class="in">temp = left
left = right
right = temp</span></pre>
          Compare it to:
<pre><span class="in">temp = left
left, right = right, left</span></pre>
          Do they always do the same thing?
          Which do you find easier to read?
        </li>

      loops,
      conditionals,
      and most importantly,
      functions.
      What they haven't done is show us how to tell if a program is getting the right
      answer.
      If (for example) each line we write has a 99% chance of being right,
      then a 70-line program will be wrong more than half the time.
      We need to do better than that,
      which means we need to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>write programs that check their own operation,</li>
      <li>write and run tests for widely-used functions, and</li>
      <li>make sure we know what "correct" actually means.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The good news is,
      doing these things will actually speed up our programming,
      not slow it down.</p>

    <h3>Assertions</h3>

    <p>The first step toward getting the right answers from our programs
      is to assume that mistakes <em>will</em> happen
      and to guard against them.
      This is called <a href="#gloss:defensive-programming">defensive programming</a>,
      and the most common way to do it is to add
      <a href="#gloss:assertion">assertions</a> to our code
      so that it checks itself as it runs.
      An assertion is simply a statement that something must be true at a certain
      point in a program.
      When Python sees one,
      it checks that the assertion's condition.
      If it's true,
      Python does nothing,
      but if it's false,
      Python halts the program immediately
      and prints the error message provided.
      For example,
      this piece of code halts as soon as the loop encounters a value that isn't
      positive:</p>

<pre><span class="in">numbers = [1.5, 2.3, 0.7, -0.001, 4.4]
total = 0.0
for n in numbers:
    assert n &gt;= 0.0, 'Data should only contain positive values'
    total += n
print 'total is:', total</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-1-33d87ea29ae4&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
      2 total = 0.0
      3 for n in numbers:
----&gt; 4     assert n &gt;= 0.0, 'Data should only contain positive values'
      5     total += n
      6 print 'total is:', total

AssertionError: Data should only contain positive values</span></pre>

    <p>Programs like the Firefox browser are full of assertions:
      10-20% of the code they contain
      are there to check that the other 80-90% are working correctly.
      Broadly speaking,
      assertions fall into three categories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="#gloss:precondition">precondition</a> is something that must be
        true
        at the start of a function in order for it to work correctly.</li>
      <li>A <a href="#gloss:postcondition">postcondition</a> is something that
        the function guarantees is true when it finishes.</li>
      <li>An <a href="#gloss:invariant">invariant</a> is something that is always true
        at a particular point inside a piece of code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example,
      suppose we are representing rectangles using a tuple of four coordinates <code>(x0, y0, x1, y1)</code>.
      In order to do some calculations,
      we need to normalize the rectangle so that it is at the origin
      and 1.0 units long on its longest axis.
      This function does that,
      but checks that its input is correctly formatted and that its result makes
      sense:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def normalize_rectangle(rect):
    assert len(rect) == 4, 'Rectangles must contain 4 coordinates'
    x0, y0, x1, y1 = rect
    assert x0 &lt; x1, 'Invalid X coordinates'
    assert y0 &lt; y1, 'Invalid Y coordinates'

    dx = x1 - x0
    dy = y1 - y0
    if dx &gt; dy:
        scaled = float(dx) / dy
        upper_x, upper_y = 1.0, scaled
    else:
        scaled = float(dx) / dy
        upper_x, upper_y = scaled, 1.0

    assert 0 &lt; upper_x &lt;= 1.0, 'Calculated upper X coordinate invalid'
    assert 0 &lt; upper_y &lt;= 1.0, 'Calculated upper Y coordinate invalid'

    return (0, 0, upper_x, upper_y)</span></pre>

    <p>The preconditions on lines 2, 4, and 5 catch invalid inputs:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print normalize_rectangle( (0.0, 1.0, 2.0) ) # missing the fourth coordinate</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------

      6

AssertionError: Invalid X coordinates</span></pre>

    <p>The post-conditions help us catch bugs by telling us when our calculations
      cannot have been correct.
      For example,
      if we normalize a rectangle that is taller than it is wide everything seems OK:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print normalize_rectangle( (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 5.0) )</span>
<span class="out">(0, 0, 0.2, 1.0)</span></pre>

    <p>but if we normalize one that's wider than it is tall,
      the assertion is triggered:</p>

<pre><span class="in">print normalize_rectangle( (0.0, 0.0, 5.0, 1.0) )</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

     16     assert 0 &lt; upper_x &lt;= 1.0, 'Calculated upper X coordinate invalid'
---&gt; 17     assert 0 &lt; upper_y &lt;= 1.0, 'Calculated upper Y coordinate invalid'
     18
     19     return (0, 0, upper_x, upper_y)

AssertionError: Calculated upper Y coordinate invalid</span></pre>

    <p>Re-reading our function,
      we realize that line 10 should divide <code>dy</code> by <code>dx</code> rather than <code>dx</code> by <code>dy</code>.
      (You can display line numbers by typing Ctrl-M, then L.)
      If we had left out the assertion at the end of the function,
      we would have created and returned something that had the right shape as a valid
      answer,
      but wasn't.
      Detecting and debugging that would almost certainly have taken more time in the
      long run
      than writing the assertion.</p>

    <p>But assertions aren't just about catching errors:
      they also help people understand programs.
      Each assertion gives the person reading the program
      a chance to check (consciously or otherwise)
      that their understanding matches what the code is doing.</p>

    <p>Most good programmers follow two rules when adding assertions to their code.
      The first is, <a href="#rule:fail-early-fail-often">fail early, fail often</a>.
      The greater the distance between when and where an error occurs and when it's
      noticed,
      the harder the error will be to debug,
      so good code catches mistakes as early as possible.</p>

    <p>The second rule is, <a href="#rule:turn-bugs-into-assertions-or-tests">turn bugs into assertions or tests</a>.
      If you made a mistake in a piece of code,
      the odds are good that you have made other mistakes nearby,
      or will make the same mistake (or a related one)
      the next time you change it.
      Writing assertions to check that you haven't
      <a href="#gloss:regression">regressed</a>
      (i.e., haven't re-introduced an old problem)
      can save a lot of time in the long run,
      and helps to warn people who are reading the code
      (including your future self)
      that this bit is tricky.</p>

    <h3>Test-Driven Development</h3>

    <p>An assertion checks that something is true at a particular point in the program.
      The next step is to check the overall behavior of a piece of code,
      i.e.,
      to make sure that it produces the right output when it's given a particular
      input.
      For example,
      suppose we need to find where two or more time series overlap.
      The range of each time series is represented as a pair of numbers,
      which are the time the interval started and ended.
      The output is the largest range that they all include:</p>

    <p><img src="python/novice/img/python-overlapping-ranges.svg" alt="Overlapping Ranges" /></p>

    <p>Most novice programmers would solve this problem like this:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Write a function <code>range_overlap</code>.</li>
      <li>Call it interactively on two or three different inputs.</li>
      <li>If it produces the wrong answer, fix the function and re-run that test.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This clearly works&mdash;after all, thousands of scientists are doing it right
      now&mdash;but
      there's a better way:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Write a short function for each test.</li>
      <li>Write a <code>range_overlap</code> function that should pass those tests.</li>
      <li>If <code>range_overlap</code> produces any wrong answers, fix it and re-run the test functions.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Writing the tests <em>before</em> writing the function they exercise
      is called <a href="#gloss:test-driven-development">test-driven development</a>
      (TDD).
      Its advocates believe it produces better code faster because:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If people write tests after writing the thing to be tested,
        they are subject to confirmation bias,
        i.e.,
        they subconsciously write tests to show that their code is correct,
        rather than to find errors.</li>
      <li>Writing tests helps programmers figure out what the function is actually
        supposed to do.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here are three test functions for <code>range_overlap</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)
assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 2.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)
assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 2.0), (-1.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-7-8d5443158f7e&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)
      2 assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 2.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)
      3 assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 2.0), (-1.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)

NameError: name 'range_overlap' is not defined</span></pre>

    <p>The error is actually reassuring:
      we haven't written <code>range_overlap</code> yet,
      so if the tests passed,
      it would be a sign that someone else had
      and that we were accidentally using their function.</p>

    <p>And as a bonus of writing these tests,
      we've implicitly defined what our input and output look like:
      we expect a list of pairs as input,
      and produce a single pair as output.</p>

    <p>Something important is missing, though.
      We don't have any tests for the case where the ranges don't overlap at all:</p>

<pre>assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (5.0, 6.0) ]) == ???</pre>

    <p>What should <code>range_overlap</code> do in this case:
      fail with an error message,
      produce a special value like <code>(0.0, 0.0)</code> to signal that there's no overlap,
      or something else?
      Any actual implementation of the function will do one of these things;
      writing the tests first helps us figure out which is best
      <em>before</em> we're emotionally invested in whatever we happened to write
      before we realized there was an issue.</p>

    <p>And what about this case?</p>

<pre>assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 2.0) ]) == ???</pre>

    <p>Do two segments that touch at their endpoints overlap or not?
      Mathematicians usually say "yes",
      but engineers usually say "no".
      The best answer is "whatever is most useful in the rest of our program",
      but again,
      any actual implementation of <code>range_overlap</code> is going to do <em>something</em>,
      and whatever it is ought to be consistent with what it does when there's no
      overlap at all.</p>

    <p>Since we're planning to use the range this function returns
      as the X axis in a time series chart,
      we decide that:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>every overlap has to have non-zero width, and</li>
      <li>we will return the special value <code>None</code> when there's no overlap.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><code>None</code> is built into Python,
      and means "nothing here".
      (Other languages often call the equivalent value <code>null</code> or <code>nil</code>).
      With that decision made,
      we can finish writing our last two tests:</p>

<pre><span class="in">assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (5.0, 6.0) ]) == None
assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 2.0) ]) == None</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-8-d877ef460ba2&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (5.0, 6.0) ]) == None
      2 assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 2.0) ]) == None

NameError: name 'range_overlap' is not defined</span></pre>

    <p>Again,
      we get an error because we haven't written our function,
      but we're now ready to do so:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def range_overlap(ranges):
    lowest = 0.0
    highest = 1.0
    for (low, high) in ranges:
        lowest = max(lowest, low)
        highest = min(highest, high)
    return (lowest, highest)</span></pre>

    <p>(Take a moment to think about why we use <code>max</code> to raise <code>lowest</code>
      and <code>min</code> to lower <code>highest</code>.)
      We'd now like to re-run our tests,
      but they're scattered across three different cells.
      To make running them easier,
      let's put them all in a function:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def test_range_overlap():
    assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)
    assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 2.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)
    assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 2.0), (-1.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)
    assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (5.0, 6.0) ]) == None
    assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 2.0) ]) == None</span></pre>

    <p>We can now test <code>range_overlap</code> with a single function call:</p>

<pre><span class="in">test_range_overlap()</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

AssertionError:</span></pre>

    <p>The first of the tests that was supposed to produce <code>None</code> fails,
      so we know there's something wrong with our function.
      What we <em>don't</em> know,
      though,
      is whether the last of our five tests passed or failed,
      because Python halted the program as soon as it spotted the first error.
      Still,
      some information is better than none,
      and if we trace the behavior of the function with that input,
      we realize that we're initializing <code>lowest</code> and <code>highest</code> to 0.0 and 1.0
      respectively,
      regardless of the input values.
      This violates another important rule of programming:
      <a href="#rule:always-initialize-from-data">always initialize from data</a>.
      We'll leave it as an exercise to fix <code>range_overlap</code>.</p>

    <h3>Debugging</h3>

    <p>Once testing has uncovered problems,
      the next step is to fix them.
      Many novices do this by making more-or-less random changes to their code
      until it seems to produce the right answer,
      but that's very inefficient
      (and the result is usually only correct for the one case they're testing).
      The more experienced a programmer is,
      the more systematically they debug,
      and most follow some variation on the rules explained below.</p>

    <h4>Know What It's Supposed to Do</h4>

    <p>The first step in debugging something is to
      <a href="#rule:know-what-its-supposed-to-do">know what it's supposed to do</a>.
      "My program doesn't work" isn't good enough:
      in order to diagnose and fix problems,
      we need to be able to tell correct output from incorrect.
      If we can write a test case for the failing case&mdash;i.e.,
      if we can assert that with <em>these</em> inputs,
      the function should produce <em>that</em> result&mdash;
      then we're ready to start debugging.
      If we can't,
      then we need to figure out how we're going to know when we've fixed things.</p>

    <p>But writing test cases for scientific software is frequently harder than
      writing test cases for commercial applications,
      because if we knew what the output of the scientific code was supposed to be,
      we wouldn't be running the software:
      we'd be writing up our results and moving on to the next program.
      In practice,
      scientists tend to do the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Test with simplified data.</em>
        Before doing statistics on a real data set,
        we should try calculating statistics for a single record,
        for two identical records,
        for two records whose values are one step apart,
        or for some other case where we can calculate the right answer by hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Test a simplified case.</em>
        If our program is supposed to simulate
        magnetic eddies in rapidly-rotating blobs of supercooled helium,
        our first test should be a blob of helium that isn't rotating,
        and isn't being subjected to any external electromagnetic fields.
        Similarly,
        if we're looking at the effects of climate change on speciation,
        our first test should hold temperature, precipitation, and other factors
        constant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Compare to an oracle.</em>
        A <a href="#gloss:test-oracle">test oracle</a> is
        something&mdash;experimental data,
        an older program whose results are trusted,
        or even a human expert&mdash;against which we can compare the results of our
        new program.
        If we have a test oracle,
        we should store its output for particular cases
        so that we can compare it with our new results as often as we like
        without re-running that program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Check conservation laws.</em>
        Mass, energy, and other quantities are conserved in physical systems,
        so they should be in programs as well.
        Similarly,
        if we are analyzing patient data,
        the number of records should either stay the same or decrease
        as we move from one analysis to the next
        (since we might throw away outliers or records with missing values).
        If "new" patients start appearing out of nowhere as we move through our
        pipeline,
        it's probably a sign that something is wrong.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Visualize.</em>
        Data analysts frequently use simple visualizations to check both
        the science they're doing
        and the correctness of their code
        (just as we did in the <a href="01-numpy.html">opening lesson</a> of this tutorial).
        This should only be used for debugging as a last resort,
        though,
        since it's very hard to compare two visualizations automatically.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Make It Fail Every Time</h4>

    <p>We can only debug something when it fails,
      so the second step is always to find a test case that
      <a href="#rule:make-it-fail-every-time">makes it fail every time</a>.
      The "every time" part is important because
      few things are more frustrating than debugging an intermittent problem:
      if we have to call a function a dozen times to get a single failure,
      the odds are good that we'll scroll past the failure when it actually occurs.</p>

    <p>As part of this,
      it's always important to check that our code is "plugged in",
      i.e.,
      that we're actually exercising the problem that we think we are.
      Every programmer has spent hours chasing a bug,
      only to realize that they were actually calling their code on the wrong data set
      or with the wrong configuration parameters,
      or are using the wrong version of the software entirely.
      Mistakes like these are particularly likely to happen when we're tired,
      frustrated,
      and up against a deadline,
      which is one of the reasons late-night (or overnight) coding sessions
      are almost never worthwhile.</p>

    <h4>Make It Fail Fast</h4>

    <p>If it takes 20 minutes for the bug to surface,
      we can only do three experiments an hour.
      That doesn't must mean we'll get less data in more time:
      we're also more likely to be distracted by other things as we wait for our
      program to fail,
      which means the time we <em>are</em> spending on the problem is less focused.
      It's therefore critical to <a href="#rule:make-it-fail-fast">make it fail fast</a>.</p>

    <p>As well as making the program fail fast in time,
      we want to make it fail fast in space,
      i.e.,
      we want to localize the failure to the smallest possible region of code:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The smaller the gap between cause and effect,
        the easier the connection is to find.
        Many programmers therefore use a divide and conquer strategy to find bugs,
        i.e.,
        if the output of a function is wrong,
        they check whether things are OK in the middle,
        then concentrate on either the first or second half,
        and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        N things can interact in N<sup>2</sup>/2 different ways,
        so every line of code that <em>isn't</em> run as part of a test
        means more than one thing we don't need to worry about.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Change One Thing at a Time, For a Reason</h4>

    <p>Replacing random chunks of code unlikely to do much good.
      (After all,
      if you got it wrong the first time,
      you'll probably get it wrong the second and third as well.)
      Good programmers therefore
      <a href="#rule:change-one-thing-at-a-time">change one thing at a time, for a reason</a>
      They are either trying to gather more information
      ("is the bug still there if we change the order of the loops?")
      or test a fix
      ("can we make the bug go away by sorting our data before processing it?").</p>

    <p>Every time we make a change,
      however small,
      we should re-run our tests immediately,
      because the more things we change at once,
      the harder it is to know what's responsible for what
      (those N<sup>2</sup> interactions again).
      And we should re-run <em>all</em> of our tests:
      more than half of fixes made to code introduce (or re-introduce) bugs,
      so re-running all of our tests tells us whether we have
      <a href="#gloss:regression">regressed</a>.</p>

    <h4>Keep Track of What You've Done</h4>

    <p>Good scientists keep track of what they've done
      so that they can reproduce their work,
      and so that they don't waste time repeating the same experiments
      or running ones whose results won't be interesting.
      Similarly,
      debugging works best when we
      <a href="#rule:keep-track-of-what-youve-done">keep track of what we've done</a>
      and how well it worked.
      If we find ourselves asking,
      "Did left followed by right with an odd number of lines cause the crash?
      Or was it right followed by left?
      Or was I using an even number of lines?"
      then it's time to step away from the computer,
      take a deep breath,
      and start working more systematically.</p>

    <p>Records are particularly useful when the time comes to ask for help.
      People are more likely to listen to us
      when we can explain clearly what we did,
      and we're better able to give them the information they need to be useful.</p>

    <h4>Be Humble</h4>

    <p>And speaking of help:
      if we can't find a bug in 10 minutes,
      we should <a href="#rule:be-humble">be humble</a> and ask for help.
      Just explaining the problem aloud is often useful,
      since hearing what we're thinking helps us spot inconsistencies and hidden
      assumptions.</p>

    <p>Asking for help also helps alleviate confirmation bias.
      If we have just spent an hour writing a complicated program,
      we want it to work,
      so we're likely to keep telling ourselves why it should,
      rather than searching for the reason it doesn't.
      People who aren't emotionally invested in the code can be more objective,
      which is why they're often able to spot the simple mistakes we have overlooked.</p>

    <p>Part of being humble is learning from our mistakes.
      Programmers tend to get the same things wrong over and over:
      either they don't understand the language and libraries they're working with,
      or their model of how things work is wrong.
      In either case,
      taking note of why the error occurred
      and checking for it next time
      quickly turns into not making the mistake at all.</p>

    <p>And that is what makes us most productive in the long run.
      As the saying goes,
      <a href="#rule:week-hard-work-hour-thought">A week of hard work can sometimes save you an hour of thought</a>.
      If we train ourselves to avoid making some kinds of mistakes,
      to break our code into modular, testable chunks,
      and to turn every assumption (or mistake) into an assertion,
      it will actually take us <em>less</em> time to produce working programs,
      not more.</p>

    <h2>Command-Line Programs</h2>

    <p>The IPython Notebook and other interactive tools are great for prototyping code
      and exploring data,
      but sooner or later we will want to use our program in a pipeline
      or run it in a shell script to process thousands of data files.
      In order to do that,
      we need to make our programs work like other Unix command-line tools.
      For example,
      we may want a program that reads a data set
      and prints the average inflammation per patient:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ipython readings.py --mean inflammation-01.csv</span>
<span class="out">5.45
5.425
6.1
...
6.4
7.05
5.9</span></pre>

    <p>but we might also want to look at the minimum of the first four lines</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">head -4 inflammation-01.csv | python readings.py --min</span></pre>

    <p>or the maximum inflammations in several files one after another:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ipython readings.py --max inflammation-*.csv</span></pre>

    <p>Our overall requirements are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If no filename is given on the command line, read data from <a href="#gloss:standard-input">standard
          input</a>.</li>
      <li>If one or more filenames are given, read data from them and report statistics
        for each file separately.</li>
      <li>Use the <code>--min</code>, <code>--mean</code>, or <code>--max</code> flag to determine what statistic to
        print.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To make this work,
      we need to know how to handle command-line arguments in a program,
      and how to get at standard input.
      We'll tackle these questions in turn below.</p>

    <div class="objectives">
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the values of command-line arguments in a program.</li>
        <li>Handle flags and files separately in a command-line program.</li>
        <li>Read data from standard input in a program so that it can be used in a pipeline.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Command-Line Arguments</h3>

    <p>Using the text editor of your choice,
      save the following in a text file called <code>sys-version.py</code>:</p>

<pre>import sys
print 'version is', sys.version</pre>

    <p>The first line imports a library called <code>sys</code>,
      which is short for "system".
      It defines values such as <code>sys.version</code>,
      which describes which version of Python we are running.
      We can run this script from within the IPython Notebook like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">%run sys-version.py</span>
<span class="out">version is 2.7.5 |Anaconda 1.6.1 (x86_64)| (default, Jun 28 2013, 22:20:13)
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)]</span></pre>

    <p>or like this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">!ipython sys-version.py</span>
<span class="out">version is 2.7.5 |Anaconda 1.6.1 (x86_64)| (default, Jun 28 2013, 22:20:13)
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)]</span></pre>

    <p>The first method, <code>%run</code>,
      uses a special command in the IPython Notebook to run a program in a <code>.py</code> file.
      The second method is more general:
      the exclamation mark <code>!</code> tells the Notebook to run a shell command,
      and it just so happens that the command we run is <code>ipython</code> with the name of the
      script.</p>

    <p>Here's another script called <code>argv-list.py</code> that does something more interesting:</p>

<pre>import sys
print 'sys.argv is', sys.argv</pre>

    <p>The strange name <code>argv</code> stands for "argument values".
      Whenever Python runs a program,
      it takes all of the values given on the command line
      and puts them in the list <code>sys.argv</code>
      so that the program can determine what they were.
      If we run this program with no arguments:</p>

<pre>$ python <span class="in">argv-list.py</span>
<span class="out">sys.argv is ['/Users/gwilson/bc/python/novice/argv-list.py']</span></pre>

    <p>the only thing in the list is the full path to our script,
      which is always <code>sys.argv[0]</code>.
      If we run it with a few arguments, however:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ipython argv-list.py first second third</span>
<span class="out">sys.argv is ['/Users/gwilson/bc/python/novice/argv-list.py', 'first', 'second', 'third']</span></pre>

    <p>then Python adds each of those arguments to that magic list.</p>

    <p>With this in hand,
      let's build a version of <code>readings.py</code> that always prints the per-patient mean
      of a single data file.
      The first step is to write a <code>main</code> function that outlines our implementation,
      and a placeholder for the function that does the actual work:</p>

<pre>import sys
import numpy as np

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    data = np.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')
    for m in data.mean(axis=1):
        print m</pre>

    <p>This function gets the name of the script from <code>sys.argv[0]</code>,
      because that's where it's always put,
      and the name of the file to process from <code>sys.argv[1]</code>.
      Here's a simple test:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ipython readings-01.py inflammation-01.csv</span></pre>

    <p>There is no output because we have defined a function,
      but haven't actually called it.
      Let's add a call to <code>main</code> to the bottom:</p>

<pre>import sys
import numpy as np

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    data = np.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')
    for m in data.mean(axis=1):
        print m

main()</pre>

    <p>and run that:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ipython readings-01.py inflammation-01.csv</span>
<span class="out">5.45
5.425
6.1
5.9
5.55
6.225
5.975
6.65
6.625
6.525
6.775
5.8
6.225
...
6.275
5.7
6.1
6.825
5.975
6.725
5.7
6.25
6.4
7.05
5.9</span></pre>

    <h3>Handling Multiple Files</h3>

    <p>The next step is to teach our program how to handle multiple files.
      Since 60 lines of output per file is a lot to page through,
      we'll start by creating three smaller files,
      each of which has three days of data for two patients:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls small-*.csv</span>
<span class="out">small-01.csv small-02.csv small-03.csv</span>
$ <span class="in">cat small-01.csv</span>
<span class="out">0,0,1
0,1,2</span>
$ <span class="in">ipython readings-02.py small-01.csv</span>
<span class="out">0.333333333333
1.0</span></pre>

    <p>Using small data files as input also allows us to check our results more easily:
      here,
      for example,
      we can see that our program is calculating the mean correctly for each line,
      whereas we were really taking it on faith before.
      This is yet another rule of programming:
      <a href="#rule:>test-simple-first">test the simple things first</a>.</p>

    <p>We want our program to process each file separately,
      so we need a loop that executes once for each filename.
      If we specify the files on the command line,
      the filenames will be in <code>sys.argv</code>,
      but we need to be careful:
      <code>sys.argv[0]</code> will always be the name of our script,
      rather than the name of a file.
      We also need to handle an unknown number of filenames,
      since our program could be run for any number of files.</p>

    <p>The solution to both problems is to loop over the contents of <code>sys.argv[1:]</code>.
      The '1' tells Python to start the slice at location 1,
      so the program's name isn't included;
      since we've left off the upper bound,
      the slice runs to the end of the list,
      and includes all the filenames.
      Here's our changed program:</p>

<pre>import sys
import numpy as np

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    for filename in sys.argv[1:]:
       data = np.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')
       for m in data.mean(axis=1):
           print m

main()</pre>

    <p>and here it is in action:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ipython readings-03.py small-01.csv small-02.csv</span>
<span class="out">0.333333333333
1.0
13.6666666667
11.0</span></pre>

    <p>Note:
      at this point,
      we have created three versions of our script called <code>readings-01.py</code>,
      <code>readings-02.py</code>, and <code>readings-03.py</code>.
      We wouldn't do this in real life:
      instead,
      we would have one file called <code>readings.py</code> that we committed to version control
      every time we got an enhancement working.
      For teaching,
      though,
      we need all the successive versions side by side.</p>

    <h3>Handling Command-Line Flags</h3>

    <p>The next step is to teach our program to pay attention to the <code>--min</code>, <code>--mean</code>,
      and <code>--max</code> flags.
      These always appear before the names of the files,
      so we could just do this:</p>

<pre>import sys
import numpy as np

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    action = sys.argv[1]
    filenames = sys.argv[2:]

    for f in filenames:
        data = np.loadtxt(f, delimiter=',')

        if action == '--min':
            values = data.min(axis=1)
        elif action == '--mean':
            values = data.mean(axis=1)
        elif action == '--max':
            values = data.max(axis=1)

        for m in values:
            print m

main()</pre>

    <p>This works:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">readings-04.py --max small-01.csv</span>
<span class="out">1.0
2.0</span></pre>

    <p>but there are several things wrong with it:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <code>main</code> is too large to read comfortably.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>action</code> isn't one of the three recognized flags,
        the program loads each file but does nothing with it
        (because none of the branches in the conditional match).
        <a href="#gloss:silent-failure">Silent failures</a> like this
        are always hard to debug.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>This version pulls the processing of each file out of the loop into a function
      of its own.
      It also checks that <code>action</code> is one of the allowed flags
      before doing any processing,
      so that the program fails fast:</p>

<pre>import sys
import numpy as np

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    action = sys.argv[1]
    filenames = sys.argv[2:]
    assert action in ['--min', '--mean', '--max'], \
           'Action is not one of --min, --mean, or --max: ' + action
    for f in filenames:
        process(f, action)

def process(filename, action):
    data = np.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')

    if action == '--min':
        values = data.min(axis=1)
    elif action == '--mean':
        values = data.mean(axis=1)
    elif action == '--max':
        values = data.max(axis=1)

    for m in values:
        print m

main()</pre>

    <p>This is four lines longer than its predecessor,
      but broken into more digestible chunks of 8 and 12 lines.</p>

    <h3>Handling Standard Input</h3>

    <p>The next thing our program has to do is read data from standard input if no
      filenames are given
      so that we can put it in a pipeline,
      redirect input to it,
      and so on.
      Let's experiment in another script called <code>count-stdin.py</code>:</p>

<pre>import sys

count = 0
for line in sys.stdin:
    count += 1

print '{0} lines in standard input'.format(count)</pre>

    <p>This little program reads lines from a special "file" called <code>sys.stdin</code>,
      which is automatically connected to the program's standard input.
      We don't have to open it&mdash;Python and the operating system
      take care of that when the program starts up&mdash;
      but we can do almost anything with it that we could do to a regular file.
      Let's try running it as if it were a regular command-line program:</p>

<pre><span class="in">ipython count-stdin.py &lt; small-01.csv</span>
<span class="out">2 lines in standard input</span></pre>

    <p>A common mistake is to try to run something that reads from standard input like this:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ipython count_stdin.py fractal_1.txt</span></pre>

    <p>i.e., to forget the <code>&lt;</code> character that redirect the file to standard input.
      In this case,
      there's nothing in standard input,
      so the program waits at the start of the loop for someone to type something on
      the keyboard.
      Since there's no way for us to do this,
      our program is stuck,
      and we have to halt it using the <code>Interrupt</code> option from the <code>Kernel</code> menu in
      the Notebook.</p>

    <p>We now need to rewrite the program so that it loads data from <code>sys.stdin</code> if no
      filenames are provided.
      Luckily,
      <code>numpy.loadtxt</code> can handle either a filename or an open file as its first
      parameter,
      so we don't actually need to change <code>process</code>.
      That leaves <code>main</code>:</p>

<pre>def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    action = sys.argv[1]
    filenames = sys.argv[2:]
    assert action in ['--min', '--mean', '--max'], \
           'Action is not one of --min, --mean, or --max: ' + action
    if len(filenames) == 0:
        process(sys.stdin, action)
    else:
        for f in filenames:
            process(f, action)</pre>

    <p>Let's try it out
      (we'll see in a moment why we send the output through <code>head</code>):</p>

    introspection, easier configuration, command completion, access to the

    <p>Whoops:
      why are we getting IPython's help rather than the line-by-line average of our
      data?
      The answer is that IPython has a hard time telling
      which command-line arguments are meant for it,
      and which are meant for the program it's running.
      To make our meaning clear,
      we have to use <code>--</code> (a double dash)
      to separate the two:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ipython readings-06.py -- --mean &lt; small-01.csv</span>
<span class="out">0.333333333333

    <p>That's better.
      In fact,
      that's done:
      the program now does everything we set out to do.</p>

    <h1 id="s:sql">Using Databases and SQL</h1>

    <p>Almost everyone has used spreadsheets,
      and almost everyone has eventually run up against their limitations.
      The more complicated a data set is,
      the harder it is to filter data,
      express relationships between different rows and columns,
      or handle missing values.</p>

    <p>Databases pick up where spreadsheets leave off.
      While they are not as simple to use if all we want is the sum of a dozen numbers,
      they can do a lot of things that spreadsheets can't,
      on much larger data sets,
      faster.
      And even if we never need to create a database ourselves,
      knowing how they work will help us understand why so many of the systems we use
      behave the way we do,
      and why they insist on structuring data in certain ways.</p>

    <p>In the late 1920s and early 1930s,
      William Dyer,
      Frank Pabodie,
      and Valentina Roerich led expeditions to the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility">Pole of Inaccessibility</a>
      in the South Pacific,
      and then onward to Antarctica.
      Two years ago,
      their expeditions were found in a storage locker at Miskatonic University.
      We have scanned and OCR'd the data they contain,
      and we now want to store that information
      in a way that will make search and analysis easy.</p>

    <p>We basically have three options:
      text files,
      a spreadsheet,
      or a database.
      Text files are easiest to create,
      and work well with version control,
      but then we would then have to build search and analysis tools ourselves.
      Spreadsheets are good for doing simple analysis,
      they don't handle large or complex data sets very well.
      We would therefore like to put this data in a database,
      and these lessons will show how to do that.</p>

    <h2>Selecting Data</h2>

    <p>A <a href="#gloss:relational-database">relational database</a>
      is a way to store and manipulate information
      that is arranged as <a href="#gloss:table-database">tables</a>.
      Each table has columns (also known as <a href="#gloss:field-database">fields</a>)
      which describe the data,
      and rows (also known as <a href="#gloss:record-database">records</a>) which
      contain the data.</p>

    <p>When we are using a spreadsheet,
      we put formulas into cells to calculate new values based on old ones.
      When we are using a database,
      we send commands
      (usually called <a href="#gloss:query">queries</a>)
      to a <a href="#gloss:database-manager">database manager</a>:
      a program that manipulates the database for us.
      The database manager does whatever lookups and calculations the query specifies,
      returning the results in a tabular form
      that we can then use as a starting point for further queries.</p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Standards Are Wonderful...</h3>

      <p>Every database manager&mdash;Oracle,
        IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft Access, and SQLite&mdash;stores
        data in a different way,
        so a database created with one cannot be used directly by another.
        However,
        every database manager can import and export data in a variety of formats,
        so it <em>is</em> possible to move information from one to another.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Queries are written in a language called <a href="#gloss:sql">SQL</a>,
      which stands for "Structured Query Language".
      SQL provides hundreds of different ways to analyze and recombine data;
      we will only look at a handful,
      but that handful accounts for most of what scientists do.</p>

    <p>The tables below show the database we will use in our examples:</p>

</tr>
</table>

    <p>Notice that three entries&mdash;one in the <code>Visited</code> table,
      and two in the <code>Survey</code> table&mdash;are shown as <code>NULL</code>.
      We'll return to these values <a href="#s:null">later</a>.
      For now,
      let's write an SQL query that displays scientists' names.
      We do this using the SQL command <code>select</code>,
      giving it the names of the columns we want and the table we want them from.
      Our query and its output look like this:</p>

<pre class="in">select family, personal from Person;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>Dyer</td><td>William</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pabodie</td><td>Frank</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lake</td><td>Anderson</td></tr>
<tr><td>Roerich</td><td>Valentina</td></tr>
<tr><td>Danforth</td><td>Frank</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>The semi-colon at the end of the query
      tells the database manager that the query is complete and ready to run.
      We have written our commands and column names in lower case,
      and the table name in Title Case,
      but we don't have to:
      as the example below shows,
      SQL is <a href="#gloss:case-insensitive">case insensitive</a>.</p>

<pre class="in">SeLeCt FaMiLy, PeRsOnAl FrOm PeRsOn;</pre>

    <p>Whatever casing convention you choose,
      please be consistent:
      complex queries are hard enough to read without the extra cognitive load of
      random capitalization.</p>

    <p>Going back to our query,
      it's important to understand that
      the rows and columns in a database table aren't actually stored in any
      particular order.
      They will always be <em>displayed</em> in some order,
      but we can control that in various ways.
      For example,
      we could swap the columns in the output by writing our query as:</p>

<pre class="in">select personal, family from Person;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>William</td><td>Dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frank</td><td>Pabodie</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anderson</td><td>Lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>Valentina</td><td>Roerich</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frank</td><td>Danforth</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>or even repeat columns:</p>

<pre class="in">select ident, ident, ident from Person;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>dyer</td><td>dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>pb</td><td>pb</td><td>pb</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>lake</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>roe</td><td>roe</td></tr>
<tr><td>danforth</td><td>danforth</td><td>danforth</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>As a shortcut,
      we can select all of the columns in a table using <code>*</code>:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Person;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>William</td><td>Dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>pb</td><td>Frank</td><td>Pabodie</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>Anderson</td><td>Lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>Valentina</td><td>Roerich</td></tr>
<tr><td>danforth</td><td>Frank</td><td>Danforth</td></tr>
</table>

    <div class="challenges">
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Write a query that selects only site names from the <code>Site</code> table.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many people format queries as:

          What style do you find easiest to read, and why?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Sorting and Removing Duplicates</h2>

    <p>Data is often redundant,
      so queries often return redundant information.
      For example,
      if we select the quantities that have been measured
      from the <code>survey</code> table,
      we get this:</p>

<pre class="in">select quant from Survey;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>temp</td></tr>
<tr><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>temp</td></tr>
<tr><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>temp</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>temp</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>rad</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>We can eliminate the redundant output
      to make the result more readable
      by adding the <code>distinct</code> keyword
      to our query:</p>

<pre class="in">select distinct quant from Survey;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>temp</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>If we select more than one column&mdash;for example,
      both the survey site ID and the quantity measured&mdash;then
      the distinct pairs of values are returned:</p>

<pre class="in">select distinct taken, quant from Survey;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>619</td><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>temp</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>temp</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>temp</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>temp</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>rad</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Notice in both cases that duplicates are removed
      even if they didn't appear to be adjacent in the database.
      Again,
      it's important to remember that rows aren't actually ordered:
      they're just displayed that way.</p>

    <p>As we mentioned earlier,
      database records are not stored in any particular order.
      This means that query results aren't necessarily sorted,
      and even if they are,
      we often want to sort them in a different way,
      e.g., by the name of the project instead of by the name of the scientist.
      We can do this in SQL by adding an <code>order by</code> clause to our query:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Person order by ident;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>danforth</td><td>Frank</td><td>Danforth</td></tr>
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>William</td><td>Dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>Anderson</td><td>Lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>pb</td><td>Frank</td><td>Pabodie</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>Valentina</td><td>Roerich</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>By default,
      results are sorted in ascending order
      (i.e.,
      from least to greatest).
      We can sort in the opposite order using <code>desc</code> (for "descending"):</p>

<pre class="in">select * from person order by ident desc;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>roe</td><td>Valentina</td><td>Roerich</td></tr>
<tr><td>pb</td><td>Frank</td><td>Pabodie</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>Anderson</td><td>Lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>William</td><td>Dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>danforth</td><td>Frank</td><td>Danforth</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>(And if we want to make it clear that we're sorting in ascending order,
      we can use <code>asc</code> instead of <code>desc</code>.)</p>

    <p>We can also sort on several fields at once.
      For example,
      this query sorts results first in ascending order by <code>taken</code>,
      and then in descending order by <code>person</code>
      within each group of equal <code>taken</code> values:</p>

<pre class="in">select taken, person from Survey order by taken asc, person desc;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td><td>dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>619</td><td>dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>pb</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>pb</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>pb</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>pb</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>pb</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>roe</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>This is easier to understand if we also remove duplicates:</p>

<pre class="in">select distinct taken, person from Survey order by taken asc, person desc;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td><td>dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>pb</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>pb</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>pb</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>roe</td></tr>
</table>

        <li>Write a query that displays scientists' full names, but orders them by surname.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Filtering</h2>

    <p>One of the most powerful features of a database is
      the ability to <a href="#gloss:filter">filter</a> data,
      i.e.,
      to select only those records that match certain criteria.
      For example,
      suppose we want to see when a particular site was visited.
      We can select these records from the <code>Visited</code> table
      by using a <code>where</code> clause in our query:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Visited where site='DR-1';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>The database manager executes this query in two stages.
      First,
      it checks at each row in the <code>Visited</code> table
      to see which ones satisfy the <code>where</code>.
      It then uses the column names following the <code>select</code> keyword
      to determine what columns to display.</p>

    <p>This processing order means that
      we can filter records using <code>where</code>
      based on values in columns that aren't then displayed:</p>

<pre class="in">select ident from Visited where site='DR-1';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td></tr>
</table>

    <p><img src="sql/novice/img/sql-filter.svg" alt="SQL Filtering in Action" /></p>

    <p>We can use many other Boolean operators to filter our data.
      For example,
      we can ask for all information from the DR-1 site collected since 1930:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Visited where (site='DR-1') and (dated&gt;='1930-00-00');</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>844</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>

      <h3>Handling Dates</h3>

      <p>Most database managers have a special data type for dates.
        In fact, many have two:
        one for dates,
        such as "May 31, 1971",
        and one for durations,
        such as "31 days".
        SQLite doesn't:
        instead,
        it stores dates as either text
        (in the ISO-8601 standard format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSSS"),
        real numbers
        (the number of days since November 24, 4714 BCE),
        or integers
        (the number of seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970).
        If this sounds complicated,
        it is,
        but not nearly as complicated as figuring out
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_calendar">historical dates in Sweden</a>.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>If we want to find out what measurements were taken by either Lake or Roerich,
      we can combine the tests on their names using <code>or</code>:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Survey where person='lake' or person='roe';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>734</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.05</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td><td>rad</td><td>2.19</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.09</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td><td>temp</td><td>-16.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>41.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>lake</td><td>rad</td><td>1.46</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.21</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>22.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>roe</td><td>rad</td><td>11.25</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Alternatively,
      we can use <code>in</code> to see if a value is in a specific set:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Survey where person in ('lake', 'roe');</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>734</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.05</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td><td>rad</td><td>2.19</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.09</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td><td>temp</td><td>-16.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>41.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>lake</td><td>rad</td><td>1.46</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.21</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>22.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>roe</td><td>rad</td><td>11.25</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>We can combine <code>and</code> with <code>or</code>,
      but we need to be careful about which operator is executed first.
      If we <em>don't</em> use parentheses,
      we get this:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Survey where quant='sal' and person='lake' or person='roe';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>734</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.05</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.09</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>41.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.21</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>22.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>roe</td><td>rad</td><td>11.25</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>which is salinity measurements by Lake,
      and <em>any</em> measurement by Roerich.
      We probably want this instead:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Survey where quant='sal' and (person='lake' or person='roe');</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>734</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.05</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.09</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>41.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>0.21</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>22.5</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Finally,
      we can use <code>distinct</code> with <code>where</code>
      to give a second level of filtering:</p>

<pre class="in">select distinct person, quant from Survey where person='lake' or person='roe';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>lake</td><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>rad</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>temp</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>sal</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>rad</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>But remember:
      <code>distinct</code> is applied to the values displayed in the chosen columns,
      not to the entire rows as they are being processed.</p>

      <h3>Growing Queries</h3>

      <p>What we have just done is how most people grow their SQL queries.
        We started with something simple that did part of what we wanted,
        then added more clauses one by one,
        testing their effects as we went.
        This is a good strategy&mdash;in fact,
        for complex queries it's often the <em>only</em> strategy&mdash;but
        it depends on quick turnaround,
        and on us recognizing the right answer when we get it.</p>

      <p>The best way to achieve quick turnaround is often
        to put a subset of data in a temporary database
        and run our queries against that,
        or to fill a small database with synthesized records.
        For example,
        instead of trying our queries against an actual database of 20 million
        Australians,
        we could run it against a sample of ten thousand,
        or write a small program to generate ten thousand random (but plausible)
        records
        and use that.</p>

    <h2>Calculating New Values</h2>

    <p>After carefully re-reading the expedition logs,
      we realize that the radiation measurements they report
      may need to be corrected upward by 5%.
      Rather than modifying the stored data,
      we can do this calculation on the fly
      as part of our query:</p>

<pre class="in">select 1.05 * reading from Survey where quant='rad';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>10.311</td></tr>
<tr><td>8.19</td></tr>
<tr><td>8.8305</td></tr>
<tr><td>7.581</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.5675</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.2995</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.533</td></tr>
<tr><td>11.8125</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>When we run the query,
      the expression <code>1.05 * reading</code> is evaluated for each row.
      Expressions can use any of the fields,
      all of usual arithmetic operators,
      and a variety of common functions.
      (Exactly which ones depends on which database manager is being used.)
      For example,
      we can convert temperature readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius
      and round to two decimal places:</p>

<pre class="in">select taken, round(5*(reading-32)/9, 2) from Survey where quant='temp';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>734</td><td>-29.72</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>-32.22</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>-28.06</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>-26.67</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>We can also combine values from different fields,
      for example by using the string concatenation operator <code>||</code>:</p>

<pre class="in">select personal || ' ' || family from Person;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>William Dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frank Pabodie</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anderson Lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>Valentina Roerich</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frank Danforth</td></tr>
</table>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>What's in a Name?</h3>

      <p>It may seem strange to use <code>personal</code> and <code>family</code> as field names
        instead of <code>first</code> and <code>last</code>,
        but it's a necessary first step toward handling cultural differences.
        For example,
        consider the following rules:</p>

<table>
  <tr> <th>Full Name</th> <th>Alphabetized Under</th> <th>Reason</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Liu Xiaobo</td> <td>Liu</td> <td>Chinese family names come first</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Leonardo da Vinci</td> <td>Leonardo</td> <td>"da Vinci" just means "from Vinci"</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Catherine de Medici</td> <td>Medici</td> <td>family name</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Jean de La Fontaine</td> <td>La Fontaine</td> <td>family name is "La Fontaine"</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Juan Ponce de Leon</td> <td>Ponce de Leon</td> <td>full family name is "Ponce de Leon"</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Gabriel Garcia Marquez</td> <td>Garcia Marquez</td> <td>double-barrelled Spanish surnames</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Wernher von Braun</td> <td>von <em>or</em> Braun</td> <td>depending on whether he was in Germany or the US</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Elizabeth Alexandra May Windsor</td> <td>Elizabeth</td> <td>monarchs alphabetize by the name under which they reigned</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Thomas a Beckett</td> <td>Thomas</td> <td>and saints according to the names by which they were canonized</td> </tr>
</table>

      <p>Clearly,
        even a two-part division into "personal" and "family"
        isn't enough...</p>

        <li>
          After further reading,
          we realize that Valentina Roerich
          was reporting salinity as percentages.
          Write a query that returns all of her salinity measurements
          from the <code>Survey</code> table
          with the values divided by 100.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>union</code> operator combines the results of two queries:

<table class="sql">
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>William</td><td>Dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>Valentina</td><td>Roerich</td></tr>

          Use <code>union</code> to create a consolidated list of salinity measurements
          in which Roerich's, and only Roerich's,
          have been corrected as described in the previous challenge.
          The output should be something like:
<table class="out">
  <tr> <td>619</td> <td>0.13</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>622</td> <td>0.09</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>734</td> <td>0.05</td> </tr>

  <tr><td>MSK-4</td></tr>

          Some major site identifiers are two letters long and some are three.
          The "in string" function <code>instr(X, Y)</code>
          returns the 1-based index of the first occurrence of string Y in string X,
          or 0 if Y does not exist in X.
          The substring function <code>substr(X, I)</code>
          returns the substring of X starting at index I.
          Use these two functions to produce a list of unique major site identifiers.
          (For this data,
          the list should contain only "DR" and "MSK").
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Missing Data</h2>

    <p>Real-world data is never complete&mdash;there are always holes.
      Databases represent these holes using special value called <code>null</code>.
      <code>null</code> is not zero, <code>False</code>, or the empty string;
      it is a one-of-a-kind value that means "nothing here".
      Dealing with <code>null</code> requires a few special tricks
      and some careful thinking.</p>

    <p>To start,
      let's have a look at the <code>Visited</code> table.
      There are eight records,
      but #752 doesn't have a date&mdash;or rather,
      its date is null:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Visited;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>DR-3</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>MSK-4</td><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Null doesn't behave like other values.
      If we select the records that come before 1930:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Visited where dated&lt;'1930-00-00';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>we get two results,
      and if we select the ones that come during or after 1930:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Visited where dated&gt;='1930-00-00';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>734</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>MSK-4</td><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>we get five,
      but record #752 isn't in either set of results.
      The reason is that
      <code>null&lt;'1930-00-00'</code>
      is neither true nor false:
      null means, "We don't know,"
      and if we don't know the value on the left side of a comparison,
      we don't know whether the comparison is true or false.
      Since databases represent "don't know" as null,
      the value of <code>null&lt;'1930-00-00'</code>
      is actually <code>null</code>.
      <code>null&gt;='1930-00-00'</code> is also null
      because we can't answer to that question either.
      And since the only records kept by a <code>where</code>
      are those for which the test is true,
      record #752 isn't included in either set of results.</p>

    <p>Comparisons aren't the only operations that behave this way with nulls.
      <code>1+null</code> is <code>null</code>,
      <code>5*null</code> is <code>null</code>,
      <code>log(null)</code> is <code>null</code>,
      and so on.
      In particular,
      comparing things to null with = and != produces null,
      so both of these commands have no output:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Visited where dated=NULL;
select * from Visited where dated!=NULL;</pre>

    <p>To check whether a value is <code>null</code> or not,
      we must use a special test <code>is null</code>:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Visited where dated is NULL;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>752</td><td>DR-3</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

    <p>or its inverse <code>is not null</code>:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Visited where dated is not NULL;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>MSK-4</td><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Null values cause headaches wherever they appear.
      For example,
      suppose we want to find the all of salinity measurements
      that weren't taken by Dyer.
      It's natural to write the query like this:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Survey where quant='sal' and person!='lake';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>0.13</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>0.09</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>41.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>22.5</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>but this query filters omits the records
      where we don't know who took the measurement.
      Once again,
      the reason is that when <code>person</code> is <code>null</code>,
      the <code>!=</code> comparison produces <code>null</code>,
      so the record isn't kept in our results.
      If we want to keep these records
      we need to add an explicit check:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Survey where quant='sal' and (person!='lake' or person is null);</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>619</td><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>0.13</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>0.09</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td></td><td>sal</td><td>0.06</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>41.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>22.5</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>We still have to decide whether this is the right thing to do or not.
      If we want to be absolutely sure that
      we aren't including any measurements by Lake in our results,
      we need to exclude all the records for which we don't know who did the work.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Write a query that sorts the records in <code>Visited</code> by date,
          omitting entries for which the date is not known
          (i.e., is null).
        </li>
        <li>
          What do you expect the query:
<pre>select * from Visited where dated in ('1927-02-08', null);</pre>
          to produce?
          What does it actually produce?

          Some database designers prefer to use
          a <a href="#gloss:sentinel-value">sentinel value</a>
          to mark missing data rather than <code>null</code>.
          For example,
          they will use the date "0000-00-00" to mark a missing date,
          or -1.0 to mark a missing salinity or radiation reading
          (since actual readings cannot be negative).
          What does this simplify?
          What burdens or risks does it introduce?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Aggregation</h2>

    <p>We now want to calculate ranges and averages for our data.
      We know how to select all of the dates from the <code>Visited</code> table:</p>

<pre class="in">select dated from Visited;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
<tr><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
<tr><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
<tr><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>but to combine them,
      we must use an <a href="#gloss:aggregation-function">aggregation function</a>
      such as <code>min</code> or <code>max</code>.
      Each of these functions takes a set of records as input,
      and produces a single record as output:</p>

<pre class="in">select min(dated) from Visited;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
</table>

    <p><img src="sql/novice/img/sql-aggregation.svg" alt="SQL Aggregation" /></p>

<pre class="in">select max(dated) from Visited;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
</table>

    <p><code>min</code> and <code>max</code> are just two of
      the aggregation functions built into SQL.
      Three others are <code>avg</code>,
      <code>count</code>,
      and <code>sum</code>:</p>

<pre class="in">select avg(reading) from Survey where quant='sal';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>7.20333333333333</td></tr>
</table>

<pre class="in">select count(reading) from Survey where quant='sal';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>9</td></tr>
</table>

<pre class="in">select sum(reading) from Survey where quant='sal';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>64.83</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>We used <code>count(reading)</code> here,
      but we could just as easily have counted <code>quant</code>
      or any other field in the table,
      or even used <code>count(*)</code>,
      since the function doesn't care about the values themselves,
      just how many values there are.</p>

    <p>SQL lets us do several aggregations at once.
      We can,
      for example,
      find the range of sensible salinity measurements:</p>

<pre class="in">select min(reading), max(reading) from Survey where quant='sal' and reading&lt;=1.0;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>0.05</td><td>0.21</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>We can also combine aggregated results with raw results,
      although the output might surprise you:</p>

<pre class="in">select person, count(*) from Survey where quant='sal' and reading&lt;=1.0;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>lake</td><td>7</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Why does Lake's name appear rather than Roerich's or Dyer's?
      The answer is that when it has to aggregate a field,
      but isn't told how to,
      the database manager chooses an actual value from the input set.
      It might use the first one processed,
      the last one,
      or something else entirely.</p>

    <p>Another important fact is that when there are no values to aggregate,
      aggregation's result is "don't know" (i.e., NULL)
      rather than zero or some other arbitrary value:</p>

<pre class="in">select person, max(reading), sum(reading) from Survey where quant='missing';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

    <p>One final important feature of aggregation functions is that
      they are inconsistent with the rest of SQL in a very useful way.
      If we add two values,
      and one of them is null,
      the result is null.
      By extension,
      if we use <code>sum</code> to add all the values in a set,
      and any of those values are null,
      the result should also be null.
      It's much more useful,
      though,
      for aggregation functions to ignore null values
      and only combine those that are non-null.
      This behavior lets us write our queries as:</p>

<pre class="in">select min(dated) from Visited;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>instead of always having to filter explicitly:</p>

<pre class="in">select min(dated) from Visited where dated is not null;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Aggregating all records at once doesn't always make sense.
      For example,
      suppose Gina suspects that there is a systematic bias in her data,
      and that some scientists' radiation readings are higher than others.
      We know that this doesn't work:</p>

<pre class="in">select person, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
from  Survey
where quant='rad';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>roe</td><td>8</td><td>6.56</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>because the database manager selects a single arbitrary scientist's name
      rather than aggregating separately for each scientist.
      Since there are only five scientists,
      she could write five queries of the form:</p>

<pre class="in">select person, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
from  Survey
where quant='rad'
and   person='dyer';</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>2</td><td>8.81</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>but this would be tedious,
      and if she ever had a data set with fifty or five hundred scientists,
      the chances of her getting all of those queries right is small.</p>

    <p>What we need to do is
      tell the database manager to aggregate the hours for each scientist separately
      using a <code>group by</code> clause:</p>

<pre class="in">select   person, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
from     Survey
where    quant='rad'
group by person;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>2</td><td>8.81</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>2</td><td>1.82</td></tr>
<tr><td>pb</td><td>3</td><td>6.66</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>1</td><td>11.25</td></tr>
</table>

    <p><code>group by</code> does exactly what its name implies:
      groups all the records with the same value for the specified field together
      so that aggregation can process each batch separately.
      Since all the records in each batch have the same value for <code>person</code>,
      it no longer matters that the database manager
      is picking an arbitrary one to display
      alongside the aggregated <code>reading</code> values.</p>

    <p>Just as we can sort by multiple criteria at once,
      we can also group by multiple criteria.
      To get the average reading by scientist and quantity measured,
      for example,
      we just add another field to the <code>group by</code> clause:</p>

<pre class="in">select   person, quant, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
from     Survey
group by person, quant;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td></td><td>sal</td><td>1</td><td>0.06</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>temp</td><td>1</td><td>-26.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>rad</td><td>2</td><td>8.81</td></tr>
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>2</td><td>0.11</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>rad</td><td>2</td><td>1.82</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>4</td><td>0.11</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>temp</td><td>1</td><td>-16.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>pb</td><td>rad</td><td>3</td><td>6.66</td></tr>
<tr><td>pb</td><td>temp</td><td>2</td><td>-20.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>rad</td><td>1</td><td>11.25</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>2</td><td>32.05</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Note that we have added <code>person</code> to the list of fields displayed,
      since the results wouldn't make much sense otherwise.</p>

    <p>Let's go one step further and remove all the entries
      where we don't know who took the measurement:</p>

<pre class="in">select   person, quant, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
from     Survey
where    person is not null
group by person, quant
order by person, quant;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>rad</td><td>2</td><td>8.81</td></tr>
<tr><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>2</td><td>0.11</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>rad</td><td>2</td><td>1.82</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>sal</td><td>4</td><td>0.11</td></tr>
<tr><td>lake</td><td>temp</td><td>1</td><td>-16.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>pb</td><td>rad</td><td>3</td><td>6.66</td></tr>
<tr><td>pb</td><td>temp</td><td>2</td><td>-20.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>rad</td><td>1</td><td>11.25</td></tr>
<tr><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>2</td><td>32.05</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>Looking more closely,
      this query:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        selected records from the <code>Survey</code> table
        where the <code>person</code> field was not null;
      </li>
      <li>
        grouped those records into subsets
        so that the <code>person</code> and <code>quant</code> values in each subset
        were the same;
      </li>
      <li>
        ordered those subsets first by <code>person</code>,
        and then within each sub-group by <code>quant</code>;
        and
      </li>
      <li>
        counted the number of records in each subset,
        calculated the average <code>reading</code> in each,
        and chose a <code>person</code> and <code>quant</code> value from each
        (it doesn't matter which ones,
        since they're all equal).
      </li>
    </ol>

          The average of a set of values is the sum of the values
          divided by the number of values.

    <h2>Combining Data</h2>

    <p>In order to submit her data to a web site
      that aggregates historical meteorological data,
      Gina needs to format it as
      latitude, longitude, date, quantity, and reading.
      However,
      her latitudes and longitudes are in the <code>Site</code> table,
      while the dates of measurements are in the <code>Visited</code> table
      and the readings themselves are in the <code>Survey</code> table.
      She needs to combine these tables somehow.</p>

    <p>The SQL command to do this is <code>join</code>.
      To see how it works,
      let's start by joining the <code>Site</code> and <code>Visited</code> tables:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Site join Visited;</pre>
<table class="sql">

</table>

    <p><code>join</code> creates
      the <a href="#gloss:cross-product">cross product</a>
      of two tables,
      i.e.,
      it joins each record of one with each record of the other
      to give all possible combinations.
      Since there are three records in <code>Site</code>
      and eight in <code>Visited</code>,
      the join's output has 24 records.
      And since each table has three fields,
      the output has six fields.</p>

    <p>What the join <em>hasn't</em> done is
      figure out if the records being joined have anything to do with each other.
      It has no way of knowing whether they do or not until we tell it how.
      To do that,
      we add a clause specifying that
      we're only interested in combinations that have the same site name:</p>

<pre class="in">select * from Site join Visited on Site.name=Visited.site;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>DR-1</td><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>619</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>DR-1</td><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>622</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>DR-1</td><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>844</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
<tr><td>DR-3</td><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>734</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
<tr><td>DR-3</td><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>735</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
<tr><td>DR-3</td><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>751</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
<tr><td>DR-3</td><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>752</td><td>DR-3</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>MSK-4</td><td>-48.87</td><td>-123.4</td><td>837</td><td>MSK-4</td><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
</table>

    <p><code>on</code> does the same job as <code>where</code>:
      it only keeps records that pass some test.
      (The difference between the two is that <code>on</code> filters records
      as they're being created,
      while <code>where</code> waits until the join is done
      and then does the filtering.)
      Once we add this to our query,
      the database manager throws away records
      that combined information about two different sites,
      leaving us with just the ones we want.</p>

    <p>Notice that we used <code>table.field</code> to specify field names
      in the output of the join.
      We do this because tables can have fields with the same name,
      and we need to be specific which ones we're talking about.
      For example,
      if we joined the <code>person</code> and <code>visited</code> tables,
      the result would inherit a field called <code>ident</code>
      from each of the original tables.</p>

    <p>We can now use the same dotted notation
      to select the three columns we actually want
      out of our join:</p>

<pre class="in">select Site.lat, Site.long, Visited.dated
from   Site join Visited
on     Site.name=Visited.site;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
<tr><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
<tr><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
<tr><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
<tr><td>-48.87</td><td>-123.4</td><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>If joining two tables is good,
      joining many tables must be better.
      In fact,
      we can join any number of tables
      simply by adding more <code>join</code> clauses to our query,
      and more <code>on</code> tests to filter out combinations of records
      that don't make sense:</p>

<pre class="in">select Site.lat, Site.long, Visited.dated, Survey.quant, Survey.reading
from   Site join Visited join Survey
on     Site.name=Visited.site
and    Visited.ident=Survey.taken
and    Visited.dated is not null;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>1927-02-08</td><td>rad</td><td>9.82</td></tr>
<tr><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>1927-02-08</td><td>sal</td><td>0.13</td></tr>
<tr><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>1927-02-10</td><td>rad</td><td>7.8</td></tr>
<tr><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>1927-02-10</td><td>sal</td><td>0.09</td></tr>

<tr><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>1930-02-26</td><td>rad</td><td>4.35</td></tr>
<tr><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>1930-02-26</td><td>sal</td><td>0.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>-47.15</td><td>-126.72</td><td>1930-02-26</td><td>temp</td><td>-18.5</td></tr>

<tr><td>-49.85</td><td>-128.57</td><td>1932-03-22</td><td>rad</td><td>11.25</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>We can tell which records from <code>Site</code>, <code>Visited</code>, and <code>Survey</code>
      correspond with each other
      because those tables contain
      <a href="#gloss:primary-key">primary keys</a>
      and <a href="#gloss:foreign-key">foreign keys</a>.
      A primary key is a value,
      or combination of values,
      that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
      A foreign key is a value (or combination of values) from one table
      that identifies a unique record in another table.
      Another way of saying this is that
      a foreign key is the primary key of one table
      that appears in some other table.
      In our database,
      <code>Person.ident</code> is the primary key in the <code>Person</code> table,
      while <code>Survey.person</code> is a foreign key
      relating the <code>Survey</code> table's entries
      to entries in <code>Person</code>.</p>

    <p>Most database designers believe that
      every table should have a well-defined primary key.
      They also believe that this key should be separate from the data itself,
      so that if we ever need to change the data,
      we only need to make one change in one place.
      One easy way to do this is
      to create an arbitrary, unique ID for each record
      as we add it to the database.
      This is actually very common:
      those IDs have names like "student numbers" and "patient numbers",
      and they almost always turn out to have originally been
      a unique record identifier in some database system or other.
      As the query below demonstrates,
      SQLite automatically numbers records as they're added to tables,
      and we can use those record numbers in queries:</p>

<pre class="in">select rowid, * from Person;</pre>
<table class="sql">
<tr><td>1</td><td>dyer</td><td>William</td><td>Dyer</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>pb</td><td>Frank</td><td>Pabodie</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>lake</td><td>Anderson</td><td>Lake</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>roe</td><td>Valentina</td><td>Roerich</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>danforth</td><td>Frank</td><td>Danforth</td></tr>
</table>

    <h3>Data Hygiene</h3>

    <p>Now that we have seen how joins work,
      we can see why the relational model is so useful
      and how best to use it.
      The first rule is that every value should be <a href="#gloss:atomic-value">atomic</a>,
      i.e.,
      not contain parts that we might want to work with separately.
      We store personal and family names in separate columns instead of putting the
      entire name in one column
      so that we don't have to use substring operations to get the name's components.
      More importantly,
      we store the two parts of the name separately because splitting on spaces is
      unreliable:
      just think of a name like "Eloise St. Cyr" or "Jan Mikkel Steubart".</p>

    <p>The second rule is that every record should have a unique primary key.
      This can be a serial number that has no intrinsic meaning,
      one of the values in the record (like the <code>ident</code> field in the <code>Person</code> table),
      or even a combination of values:
      the triple <code>(taken, person, quant)</code> from the <code>Survey</code> table uniquely identifies
      every measurement.</p>

    <p>The third rule is that there should be no redundant information.
      For example,
      we could get rid of the <code>Site</code> table and rewrite the <code>Visited</code> table like this:</p>

<table class="sql">

    <p>In fact,
      we could use a single table that recorded all the information about each reading
      in each row,
      just as a spreadsheet would.
      The problem is that it's very hard to keep data organized this way consistent:
      if we realize that the date of a particular visit to a particular site is wrong,
      we have to change multiple records in the database.
      What's worse,
      we may have to guess which records to change,
      since some other sites may actually have been visited on that date.</p>

    <p>The fourth rule is that the units for every value should be stored explicitly.
      Our database doesn't do this,
      and that's a problem:
      Roerich's salinity measurements are several orders of magnitude larger than
      anyone else's,
      but we don't know if that means she was using parts per million instead of parts
      per thousand,
      or whether there actually was a saline anomaly at that site in 1932.</p>

    <h2>Creating and Modifying Data</h2>

    <p>So far we have only looked at how to get information out of a database,
      both because that is more frequent than adding information,
      and because most other operations only make sense
      once queries are understood.
      If we want to create and modify data,
      we need to know two other pairs of commands.</p>

    <p>The first pair are <code>create table</code> and <code>drop table</code>.
      While they are written as two words,
      they are actually single commands.
      The first one creates a new table;
      its arguments are the names and types of the table's columns.
      For example,
      the following statements create the four tables in our survey database:</p>

<pre class="in">create table Person(ident text, personal text, family text);
create table Site(name text, lat real, long real);
create table Visited(ident integer, site text, dated text);
create table Survey(taken integer, person text, quant real, reading real);</pre>

    <p>We can get rid of one of our tables using:</p>

<pre class="in">drop table Survey;</pre>

    <p>Be very careful when doing this:
      most databases have some support for undoing changes,
      but it's better not to have to rely on it.</p>

    <p>Different database systems support different data types for table columns,
      but most provide the following:</p>

<table>
  <tr> <td>integer</td> <td>a signed integer</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>real</td> <td>a floating point number</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>text</td> <td>a character string</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>blob</td> <td>a "binary large object", such as an image</td> </tr>
</table>

    <p>Most databases also support Booleans and date/time values;
      SQLite uses the integers 0 and 1 for the former,
      and represents the latter as discussed <a href="#a:dates">earlier</a>.
      An increasing number of databases also support geographic data types,
      such as latitude and longitude.
      Keeping track of what particular systems do or do not offer,
      and what names they give different data types,
      is an unending portability headache.</p>

    <p>When we create a table,
      we can specify several kinds of constraints on its columns.
      For example,
      a better definition for the <code>Survey</code> table would be:</p>

<pre class="in">create table Survey(
    taken   integer not null, -- where reading taken
    person  text,             -- may not know who took it
    quant   real not null,    -- the quantity measured
    reading real not null,    -- the actual reading
    primary key(taken, quant),
    foreign key(taken) references Visited(ident),
    foreign key(person) references Person(ident)
);</pre>

    <p>Once again,
      exactly what constraints are available
      and what they're called
      depends on which database manager we are using.</p>

    <p>Once tables have been created,
      we can add and remove records using our other pair of commands,
      <code>insert</code> and <code>delete</code>.
      The simplest form of <code>insert</code> statement lists values in order:</p>

<pre class="in">insert into Site values('DR-1', -49.85, -128.57);
insert into Site values('DR-3', -47.15, -126.72);
insert into Site values('MSK-4', -48.87, -123.40);</pre>

    <p>We can also insert values into one table directly from another:</p>

<pre class="in">create table JustLatLong(lat text, long TEXT);
insert into JustLatLong select lat, long from site;</pre>

    <p>Deleting records can be a bit trickier,
      because we have to ensure that the database remains internally consistent.
      If all we care about is a single table,
      we can use the <code>delete</code> command with a <code>where</code> clause
      that matches the records we want to discard.
      For example,
      once we realize that Frank Danforth didn't take any measurements,
      we can remove him from the <code>Person</code> table like this:</p>

<pre class="in">delete from Person where ident = "danforth";</pre>

    <p>But what if we removed Anderson Lake instead?
      Our <code>Survey</code> table would still contain seven records
      of measurements he'd taken,
      but that's never supposed to happen:
      <code>Survey.person</code> is a foreign key into the <code>Person</code> table,
      and all our queries assume there will be a row in the latter
      matching every value in the former.</p>

    <p>This problem is called <a href="#gloss:referential-integrity">referential integrity</a>:
      we need to ensure that all references between tables can always be resolved
      correctly.
      One way to do this is to delete all the records
      that use <code>'lake'</code> as a foreign key
      before deleting the record that uses it as a primary key.
      If our database manager supports it,
      we can automate this
      using <a href="#gloss:cascading-delete">cascading delete</a>.
      However,
      this technique is outside the scope of this chapter.</p>

      <h3>There's More Than One Way to Do It</h3>

      <p>Many applications use a hybrid storage model
        instead of putting everything into a database:
        the actual data (such as astronomical images) is stored in files,
        while the database stores the files' names,
        their modification dates,
        the region of the sky they cover,
        their spectral characteristics,
        and so on.
        This is also how most music player software is built:
        the database inside the application keeps track of the MP3 files,
        but the files themselves live on disk.</p>

    <h2>Programming with Databases</h2>

    <p>To close,
      let's have a look at how to access a database from
      a general-purpose programming language like Python.
      Other languages use almost exactly the same model:
      library and function names may differ,
      but the concepts are the same.</p>

    <p>Here's a short Python program that selects latitudes and longitudes
      from an SQLite database stored in a file called <code>survey.db</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">import sqlite3
connection = sqlite3.connect("survey.db")
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute("select site.lat, site.long from site;")
results = cursor.fetchall()
for r in results:
    print r
cursor.close()
connection.close()</span>
<span class="out">(-49.85, -128.57)
(-47.15, -126.72)
(-48.87, -123.4)</span></pre>

    <p>The program starts by importing the <code>sqlite3</code> library.
      If we were connecting to MySQL, DB2, or some other database,
      we would import a different library,
      but all of them provide the same functions,
      so that the rest of our program does not have to change
      (at least, not much)
      if we switch from one database to another.</p>

<p>Line 2 establishes a connection to the database.
  Since we're using SQLite,
  all we need to specify is the name of the database file.
  Other systems may require us to provide a username and password as well.
  Line 3 then uses this connection to create
  a <a href="#gloss:cursor">cursor</a>;
  just like the cursor in an editor,
  its role is to keep track of where we are in the database.</p>

<p>On line 4, we use that cursor to ask the database to execute a query for us.
  The query is written in SQL,
  and passed to <code>cursor.execute</code> as a string.
  It's our job to make sure that SQL is properly formatted;
  if it isn't,
  or if something goes wrong when it is being executed,
  the database will report an error.</p>

<p>The database returns the results of the query to us
  in response to the <code>cursor.fetchall</code> call on line 5.
  This result is a list with one entry for each record in the result set;
  if we loop over that list (line 6) and print those list entries (line 7),
  we can see that each one is a tuple
  with one element for each field we asked for.</p>

<p>Finally, lines 8 and 9 close our cursor and our connection,
  since the database can only keep a limited number of these open at one time.
  Since establishing a connection takes time,
  though,
  we shouldn't open a connection,
  do one operation,
  then close the connection,
  only to reopen it a few microseconds later to do another operation.
  Instead,
  it's normal to create one connection that stays open for the lifetime of the
  program.</p>

<p>Queries in real applications will often depend on values provided by users.
  For example,
  this function takes a user's ID as a parameter and returns their name:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def get_name(database_file, person_ident):
    query = "select personal || ' ' || family from Person where ident='" + person_ident + "';"

    connection = sqlite3.connect(database_file)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()

    return results[0][0]

print "full name for dyer:", get_name('survey.db', 'dyer')</span>
<span class="out">full name for dyer: William Dyer</span></pre>

    <p>We use string concatenation on the first line of this function
      to construct a query containing the user ID we have been given.
      This seems simple enough,
      but what happens if someone gives us this string as input?</p>

<pre>dyer'; drop table Survey; select '</pre>

    <p>It looks like there's garbage after the name of the project,
      but it is very carefully chosen garbage.
      If we insert this string into our query,
      the result is:</p>

<pre>select personal || ' ' || family from Person where ident='dyer'; drop tale Survey; select '';</pre>

    <p>If we execute this,
      it will erase one of the tables in our database.</p>

    <p>This is called an <a href="#gloss:sql-injection-attack">SQL injection attack</a>,
      and it has been used to attack thousands of programs over the years.
      In particular,
      many web sites that take data from users insert values directly into queries
      without checking them carefully first.</p>

    <p>Since a villain might try to smuggle commands into our queries in many different
      ways,
      the safest way to deal with this threat is
      to replace characters like quotes with their escaped equivalents,
      so that we can safely put whatever the user gives us inside a string.
      We can do this by using a <a href="#gloss:prepared-statement">prepared statement</a>
      instead of formatting our statements as strings.
      Here's what our example program looks like if we do this:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def get_name(database_file, person_ident):
    query = "select personal || ' ' || family from Person where ident=?;"

    connection = sqlite3.connect(database_file)
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query, [person_ident])
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()

    return results[0][0]

print "full name for dyer:", get_name('survey.db', 'dyer')</span>
<span class="out">full name for dyer: William Dyer</span></pre>

    <p>The key changes are in the query string and the <code>execute</code> call.
      Instead of formatting the query ourselves,
      we put question marks in the query template where we want to insert values.
      When we call <code>execute</code>,
      we provide a list
      that contains as many values as there are question marks in the query.
      The library matches values to question marks in order,
      and translates any special characters in the values
      into their escaped equivalents
      so that they are safe to use.</p>

    <h2>SQL</h2>

    <h2>Basic Queries</h2>

    <p>Select one or more columns from a table:</p>

<pre>SELECT column_name_1, column_name_2 FROM table_name;</pre>

    <p>Select all columns from a table:</p>

<pre>SELECT * FROM table_name;</pre>

    <p>Get only unique results in a query:</p>

<pre>SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;</pre>

    <p>Perform calculations in a query:</p>

<pre>SELECT column_name_1, ROUND(column_name_2 / 1000.0) FROM table_name;</pre>

    <p>Sort results in ascending order:</p>

<pre>SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name_1;</pre>

    <p>Sort results in ascending and descending order:</p>

<pre>SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name_1 ASC, column_name_2 DESC;</pre>

    <h2>Filtering</h2>

    <p>Select only data meeting a condition:</p>

<pre>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name &gt; 0;</pre>

    <p>Select only data meeting a combination of conditions:</p>

<pre>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE (column_name_1 &gt;= 1000) AND (column_name_2 = 'A' OR column_name_2 = 'B');</pre>

    <h2>Missing Data</h2>

    <p>Use <code>NULL</code> to represent missing data.</p>

    <p><code>NULL</code> is not 0, false, or any other specific value.
Operations involving <code>NULL</code> produce <code>NULL</code>, so <code>1+NULL</code>, <code>2&gt;NULL</code>, and <code>3=NULL</code> are all <code>NULL</code>.</p>

    <p>Test whether a value is null:</p>

<pre>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;</pre>

    <p>Test whether a value is not null:</p>

<pre>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;</pre>

    <h2>Grouping and Aggregation</h2>

    <p>Combine values using aggregation functions:</p>

<pre>SELECT SUM(column_name_1) FROM table_name;</pre>

    <p>Combine data into groups and calculate combined values in groups:</p>

<pre>SELECT column_name_1, SUM(column_name_2), COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name_1;</pre>

    <h2>Joins</h2>

    <p>Join data from two tables:</p>

<pre>SELECT * FROM table_name_1 JOIN table_name_2 ON table_name_1.column_name = table_name_2.column_name;</pre>

    <h2>Writing Queries</h2>

    <p>SQL commands must be combined in the following order:
      <code>SELECT</code>, <code>FROM</code>, <code>JOIN</code>, <code>ON</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, <code>GROUP BY</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code>.</p>

    <h2>Creating Tables</h2>

    <p>Create tables by specifying column names and types.
      Include primary and foreign key relationships and other constraints.</p>

<pre>CREATE TABLE survey(
    taken   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    person  TEXT,
    quant   REAL NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(taken, quant),
    FOREIGN KEY(person) REFERENCES person(ident)
);</pre>

    <h2>Programming</h2>

    <p>Execute queries in a general-purpose programming language by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>loading the appropriate library</li>
      <li>creating a connection</li>
      <li>creating a cursor</li>
      <li>repeatedly:
        <ul>
          <li>execute a query</li>
          <li>fetch some or all results</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>disposing of the cursor</li>
      <li>closing the connection</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Python example:</p>

<pre>import sqlite3
connection = sqlite3.connect("database_name")
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute("...query...")
for r in cursor.fetchall():
    ...process result r...
cursor.close()
connection.close()</pre>

    <h1 id="s:guide">Instructor's Guide</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Live coding is by far the best way to teach people the shell.
        However,
        once the instructor enlarges the font in her window
        so that people at the back of the room can read it,
        she will typically only have 45 columns and 20 rows.
        Previous commands and their output will therefore disappear quickly,
        and the instructor may have to flip windows
        back and forth between the shell and her editor,
        which can confuse learners
        (even when different background colors are used
        for the different windows).
        Other than using multiple screens,
        there is no good solution for this problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instructors are usually able to type faster than learners,
        and even when they can't,
        learners have the double burden of watching and then typing,
        rather than simply typing.
        Instructors must therefore be very careful not to race ahead.
        They should also use Etherpad or some other collaborative real-time editor
        to share commands and sample data files with learners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many people arrive knowing everything we're going to teach and more.
        We can keep them engaged by having them help people beside them,
        and by reiterating the philosophical parts of the presentation
        (e.g., "save history and edit to create a shell script").
      </li>
      <li>
        People learn more, and more quickly,
        when they are pair programming.
        Having learners work together is also a good way
        to deal with installation and setup issues:
        if someone can't get something running on their machine,
        they can usually work with a partner,
        and it's less awkward for them to do so
        if everyone's already partnered anyway.
        Theater seating makes pairing more difficult than restaurant seating,
        so whenever possible,
        try to get a space with a flat floor,
        tables,
        and room for helpers to wander around.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Unix Shell</h2>

    <p>Many people have questioned whether we should still teach the shell.
      After all,
      anyone who wants to rename several thousand data files
      can easily do so interactively in the Python interpreter,
      and anyone who's doing serious data analysis
      is probably going to do most of their work inside the IPython Notebook or R Studio.
      So why teach the shell?</p>

    <p>The first answer is,
      "Because so much else depends on it."
      Installing software,
      configuring your default editor,
      and controlling remote machines frequently assume a basic familiarity with the shell,
      and with related ideas like standard input and output.
      Many tools also use its terminology
      (for example, the <code>%ls</code> and <code>%cd</code> magic commands in IPython).</p>

    <p>The second answer is,
      "Because it's an easy way to introduce some fundamental ideas about how to use computers."
      As we teach people how to use the Unix shell,
      we teach them that they should get the computer to repeat things
      (via tab completion,
      <code>!</code> followed by a command number,
      and <code>for</code> loops)
      rather than repeating things themselves.
      We also teach them to take things they've discovered they do frequently
      and save them for later re-use
      (via shell scripts),
      to give things sensible names,
      and to write a little bit of documentation
      (like comment at the top of shell scripts)
      to make their future selves' lives better.</p>

    <p>Finally,
      and perhaps most importantly,
      teaching people the shell lets us teach them
      to think about programming in terms of function composition.
      In the case of the shell,
      this takes the form of pipelines rather than nested function calls,
      but the core idea of "small pieces, loosely joined" is the same.</p>

    <p>All of this material can be covered in three hours
      as long as learners using Windows do not run into roadblocks such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>not being able to figure out where their home directory is
        (particularly if they're using Cygwin);</li>
      <li>not being able to run a plain text editor;
        and</li>
      <li>the shell refusing to run scripts that include DOS line endings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Teaching Notes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Have learners open a shell
        and then do <code>whoami</code>,
        <code>pwd</code>,
        and <code>ls</code>.
        Then have them create a directory called <code>bootcamp</code>
        and <code>cd</code> into it,
        so that everything else they do during the lesson
        is unlikely to harm whatever files they already have.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get them to run an editor
        and save a file in their <code>bootcamp</code> directory
        as early as possible.
        Doing this is usually the biggest stumbling block during the entire lesson:
        many will try to run the same editor as the instructor
        (which may leave them trapped in the awful nether hell that is Vim),
        or will not know how to navigate to the right directory
        to save their file,
        or will run a word processor rather than a plain text editor.
        The quickest way past these problems is to have more knowledgeable learners
        help those who need it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tab completion sounds like a small thing: it isn't.
        Re-running old commands using <code>!123</code> or <code>!wc</code>
        isn't a small thing either,
        and neither are wildcard expansion and <code>for</code> loops.
        Each one is an opportunity to repeat one of the big ideas of Software Carpentry:
        if the computer <em>can</em> repeat it,
        some programmer somewhere will almost certainly have built
        some way for the computer <em>to</em> repeat it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Building up a pipeline with four or five stages,
        then putting it in a shell script for re-use
        and calling that script inside a <code>for</code> loop,
        is a great opportunity to show how
        "seven plus or minus two"
        connects to programming.
        Once we have figured out how to do something moderately complicated,
        we make it re-usable and give it a name
        so that it only takes up one slot in working memory
        rather than several.
        It is also a good opportunity to talk about exploratory programming:
        rather than designing a program up front,
        we can do a few useful things
        and then retroactively decide which are worth encapsulating
        for future re-use.
      </li>
      <li>
        We have to leave out many important things because of time constraints,
        including file permissions, job control, and SSH.
        If learners already understand the basic material,
        this can be covered instead using the online lessons as guidelines.
      </li>
      <li>
        Installing Bash and a reasonable set of Unix commands on Windows
        always involves some fiddling and frustration.
        Please see the latest set of installation guidelines for advice,
        and try it out yourself <em>before</em> teaching a class.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Git</h2>

    <p>Version control might be the most important topic we teach,
      but Git is definitely the most complicated tool.
      However,
      GitHub presently dominates the open software forge landscape,
      so we have to help novices learn just enough Git
      to feel they can and should learn more on their own.</p>

    <p>This is why we don't teach branching:
      while it is a power tool in the hands of a knowledgeable user,
      it is an extra cognitive burden for someone who is new to the idea of version control.
      This is also why we don't get into hashes and commit objects with novices,
      but try instead to convince them that version control is:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>a better backup system;</li>
      <li>a better Dropbox; and</li>
      <li>a better way to collaborate than mailing files back and forth.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We close with material on licensing because:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>questions about who owns what, or can use what,
        arise naturally once we start talking about
        using public services like GitHub to store files;
        and</li>
      <li>the discussion gives learners a chance to catch their breath
        after what is often a frustrating couple of hours.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Teaching Notes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Make sure the network is working <em>before</em> starting this lesson.
      </li>
      <li>
        Give learners a five-minute overview of what version control does for them
        before diving into the watch-and-do practicals.
        Most of them will have tried to co-author papers by emailing files back and forth,
        or will have biked into the office
        only to realize that the USB key with last night's work
        is still on the kitchen table.
        Instructors can also make jokes about directories with names like
        "final version",
        "final version revised",
        "final version with reviewer three's corrections",
        "really final version",
        and,
        "come on this really has to be the last version"
        to motivate version control as a better way to collaborate
        and as a better way to back work up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Version control is typically taught after the shell,
        so collect learners' names during that session
        and create a repository for them to share
        with their names as both their IDs and their passwords.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your learners are advanced enough to be comfortable SSH,
        tell them they can use keys to authenticate on GitHub instead of passwords,
        but don't try to set this up during class:
        it takes too long,
        and is a distraction from the core ideas of the lesson.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be very clear what files learners are to edit
        and what user IDs they are to use
        when giving instructions.
        It is common for them to edit the instructor's biography,
        or to use the instructor's user ID and password when committing.
        Be equally clear <em>when</em> they are to edit things:
        it's also common for someone to edit the file the instructor is editing
        and commit changes while the instructor is explaining what's going on,
        so that a conflict occurs when the instructor comes to commit the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        If some learners are using Windows,
        there will inevitably be issues merging files with different line endings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Python</h2>

    <p>This lesson is written as an introduction to Python,
      but its real purpose is to introduce the single most important idea in programming:
      how to solve problems by building functions,
      each of which can fit in a programmer's working memory.
      In order to teach that,
      we must teach people a little about
      the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O
      so that their functions can do things they actually care about.
      Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced;
      instructors should resist the temptation to explain
      the "other 90%" of the language
      as well.</p>

    <p>The secondary goal of this lesson is to give them a usable mental model of how programs run
      (what computer science educators call a <a href="../../gloss.html#notional-machine">notional machine</a>
      so that they can debug things when they go wrong.
      In particular,
      they must understand how function call stacks work.</p>

    <p>The final example asks them to build a command-line tool
      that works with the Unix pipe-and-filter model.
      We do this because it is a useful skill
      and because it helps learners see that the software they use isn't magical.
      Tools like <code>grep</code> might be more sophisticated than
      the programs our learners can write at this point in their careers,
      but it's crucial they realize this is a difference of scale rather than kind.</p>

    <h3>Teaching Notes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Watching the instructor grow programs step by step
        is as helpful to learners as anything to do with Python.
        Resist the urge to update a single cell repeatedly
        (which is what you'd probably do in real life).
        Instead,
        clone the previous cell and write the update in the new copy
        so that learners have a complete record of how the program grew.
        Once you've done this,
        you can say,
        "Now why don't we just breaks things into small functions right from the start?"
      </li>
      <li>
        The discussion of command-line scripts
        assumes that students understand standard I/O and building filters,
        which are covered in the lesson on the shell.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SQL</h2>

    <p>Relational databases are not as widely used in science as in business,
      but they are still a common way to store large data sets with complex structure.
      Even when the data itself isn't in a database,
      the metadata could be:
      for example,
      meteorological data might be stored in files on disk,
      but data about when and where observations were made,
      data ranges,
      and so on could be in a database
      to make it easier for scientists to find what they want to.</p>

    <h3>Teaching Notes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The first few sections (up to "Missing Data") usually go very quickly.
        The pace usually slows down a bit when null values are discussed
        mostly because learners have a lot of details to keep straight by this point.
        Things <em>really</em> slow down during the discussion of joins,
        but this is the key idea in the whole lesson:
        important ideas like primary keys and referential integrity
        only make sense once learners have seen how they're used in joins.
        It's worth going over things a couple of times if necessary (with lots of examples).
      </li>
      <li>
        The sections on creating and modifying data,
        and programming with databases,
        can be dropped if time is short.
        Of the two,
        people seem to care most about how to add data (which only takes a few minutes to demonstrate).
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall,
        this material takes three hours to present assuming that a short exercise is done with each topic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simple calculations are actually easier to do in a spreadsheet;
        the advantages of using a database become clear as soon as filtering and joins are needed.
        Instructors may therefore want to show a spreadsheet with the information from the four database tables
        consolidated into a single sheet,
        and demonstrate what's needed in both systems to answer questions like,
        "What was the average radiation reading in 1931?"
      </li>
      <li>Some learners may have heard that NoSQL databases
        (i.e., ones that don't use the relational model)
        are the next big thing,
        and ask why we're not teaching those.
        The answers are:
        <ol>
          <li>Relational databases are far more widely used than NoSQL databases.</li>
          <li>We have far more experience with relational databases than with any other kind,
            so we have a better idea of what to teach and how to teach it.</li>
          <li>NoSQL databases are as different from each other as they are from relational databases.
            Until a leader emerges, it isn't clear <em>which</em> NoSQL database we should teach.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Run <code>sqlite3 survey.db &lt; gen-survey-database.sql</code>
        to re-create survey database before loading notebooks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="s:think">Thinking Like a Programmer</h1>

    <p>We're going to wrap up these lessons by looking at a few key ideas that underpin everything else we've done.
      We have left them to the end because like most big ideas,
      they don't make sense until you have seen the examples that they are generalizations of.</p>

    <p>Our seven principles are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>It's all just data.</li>
      <li>Data doesn't mean anything on its own&mdash;it has to be interpreted.</li>
      <li>Programming is about creating and composing abstractions.</li>
      <li>Models are for computers, and views are for people.</li>
      <li>Paranoia makes us productive.</li>
      <li>Better algorithms are better than better hardware.</li>
      <li>The tool shapes the hand.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Let's take them in order.
      First, and most importantly, <strong>it's all just data</strong>.
      Shopping lists, email, pictures of far-off galaxies:
      inside the computer, they're all just ones and zeroes.</p>

    <p>Even programs are just data:
      in fact, this is the key insight that all of modern computing is built on.
      The source code for a program is just a bunch of text files, no different from a thesis.
      Once that text is compiled or loaded into memory,
      it's just bytes too, and pushing those bytes around is no different from correcting a typo in an address list
      or changing the color of a pixel in an image file.</p>

    <p>If you understand this&mdash;if you understand that programs are just another kind of data&mdash;then
      every bit of programming you do will be easier.</p>

    <p>The second idea is a complement to the first.
      <strong>Data doesn't mean anything on its own&mdash;it has to be interpreted</strong>.
      The thirty-two bits 01100100011000010111100001100001 are simultaneously the word 'data',
      the integer 1,
      84,108,385,
      the floating-point number 1.6635613602263159e+22,
      a bluish-gray pixel that's slightly transparent,
      a medium-loud sound sample with slightly higher volume in the left channel,
      an instruction to copy the content of register 100 to a location in memory that's 97 bytes past
      the address currently stored in register 116,
      or a point near the outer edge of one of the superconducting magnets in a CAT scanner
      if the file those four bytes are in is a CAD model.</p>

    <p>The reason for this is that machines don't understand; they obey.
      If you look at this image, you can't help but see the word "data":</p>

    <p><img src="thinking/img/data.png" alt="The Word 'Data'" /></p>

    <p>A machine doesn't;
      it doesn't even see four blobs of blue pixels on a gray background,
      because it doesn't "see" anything.
      The computer stores this image, and a program, as bits in memory.
      If those bits happen to correspond to instructions for the computer's CPU,
      and if those instructions happen to make up a program for detecting shapes in images
      and matching those shapes with letters in the alphabet,
      then the computer may very well output "data",
      but <em>it doesn't understand</em>.
      Calling a variable "temperature" doesn't mean the computer will store
      a temperature in it&mdash;it would do exactly the same thing
      if the variable was called "pressure" or "frankenstein" or "a7".</p>

    <p>This brings us to the third idea:
      <strong>programming is about creating and composing abstractions</strong>.
      Our brains can only keep track of a few things at once,
      so if we want to understand something, we have to stuff the details into boxes
      and put labels on them like "find the maximum" or "patient record".</p>

    <p>One key to making abstraction work is to separate <em>interface</em> and <em>implementation</em>.
      An interface is what something knows how to do: the questions it can answer,
      or the operations it can carry out.
      Its implementation is how it does those things:
      what data it stores, what algorithms it uses, and so on.
      There can be dozens of ways to implement a particular interface;
      if we do our work well,
      we shouldn't have to care about the implementation until something goes wrong or we need to improve its performance.
      "Spare me the details" may be rude in real life, but it's essential in programming.</p>

    <p>Another key to making abstraction work is to always choose clarity over cleverness.
      As Brian Kernighan once said,
      "&hellip;debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place.
      So if you are as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?"
      Programs are among the most complex things human beings have ever created;
      it may be tempting to use little tricks here and there to make them smaller or faster,
      but somebody (maybe you) is going to have to figure it out again later,
      and really, nobody likes being tricked.</p>

    <p>One implication of the abstraction principle is important enough to be our fourth principle in its own right:
      <strong>models are for computers, and views are for people</strong>.
      A model is a representation of something that is easy for a computer to operate on;
      a view is a way of displaying part or all of that model that human beings can understand.</p>

    <p>For example, an HTML document consists of elements with attributes that contain other elements or blocks of raw text:</p>

    <p><img src="thinking/img/modelview.png" alt="Models vs. Views" /></p>

    <p>That model can be rendered in a browser,
      turned into speech for someone who is visually impaired,
      or displayed as text using angle brackets, quotes, and some indentation.
      None of these <em>is</em> the model:
      they're all views that make the model's content accessible to human beings in different contexts.
      The model itself isn't just easier for the computer to work with:
      it's essential,
      since as we said before,
      the computer can't "see" the views that we create for human beings.</p>

    <p>Turning one of those views back into a model is hard:
      parsing the textual representation of HTML takes thousands of lines of code,
      and doing OCR or speech recognition to translate the rendered page or its spoken equivalent can take millions.
      What big idea number four implies,
      therefore,
      is that <em>structured data is better than unstructured data</em>.
      The tags and attributes in the textual representation of an HTML page are there because without it,
      the computer  can't tell whether something is in italics
      because it's being emphasized or because it's the title of a book.
      To borrow an example from Jon Udell,
      a PDF with a cartoon whose caption says,
      "The knitting circle meets on the second Tuesday of every month"
      is a lot easier for human beings to understand than a blob of iCal-formatted text,
      but the second is much easier for the computer:</p>

    <p><img src="thinking/img/structured.png" alt="Structured vs. Unstructured Data" /></p>

    <p>We said earlier that we only want to care about how something is implemented
      when things go wrong or when we need to improve its performance.
      Big idea number five is about things going wrong,
      and can be summed up by saying that <strong>paranoia makes us productive</strong>.
      The best way&mdash;in fact, the only way&mdash;to improve productivity is to improve quality,
      and this starts before we write the first line of code.
      "I want to count all the stars in this photograph" is easy to say,
      but what does it actually <em>mean</em>?
      What constitutes a star?
      When do you decide that a lumpy blob of pixels is two stars rather than one, or three instead of two?
      Every program embodies decisions about questions like these,
      even if you don't realize that there was a question and that you made a choice.
      The sooner we worry about this, the less time we'll waste building the wrong thing.</p>

    <p>Of course, we don't stop worrying once we've typed our code in.
      We check that data is formatted properly to protect ourselves against "garbage in, garbage out".
      We put checks in our code to make sure that parameters are sensible,
      data structures consistent,
      files aren't empty,
      and so on.
      And we write tests, and use a build system, to catch errors as soon as possible.
      This might feel like it's slowing us down at first,
      but study after study has shown that it works.</p>

    <p>One of the best ways to apply this principle,
      by the way,
      is to automate everything.
      As Alfred North Whitehead said,
      "Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them."
      We don't just write programs because we want to do things quickly:
      we write them because we don't want to do some things ever again.
      Version control systems keep track of our work for us;
      spreadsheets update graphs and summary statistics whenever a single value changes,
      and so on.
      Every time we automate a task,
      we reduce the chances of getting it wrong the next time,
      and have more time to think about things that machines <em>can't</em> do for us.
      And it's not just a one-time saving:
      if we automate things well, that extra time is ours over and over again.</p>

    <p>Big idea number six is that we can think about how fast the algorithms embodied in programs are,
      and that <strong>better algorithms are better than better hardware</strong>.
      One of the greatest mathematical advances of the Twentieth Century was the idea of <em>algorithmic complexity</em>,
      and its practical implications shape everything we do with computers,
      whether we realize it or not.
      The basic idea is that we can estimate how many operations an algorithm will do,
      or how much memory it requires, as a function of the size of the problem we're trying to solve.
      It turns out that some algorithms slow down gently as their inputs get larger,
      while others slow down so much that even if the whole universe was one large computer,
      it couldn't solve any problem big enough to be interesting.
      Faster chips help&mdash;a lot&mdash;but the real key to speed is
      to focus on what we're doing,
      not what we're doing it with.</p>

    <p>But algorithms are nothing without data structures to operate on,
      just as data structures are pointless without algorithms to manipulate them.
      That's why the two topics are usually taught together:
      arrays with loops, trees with recursion, and so on.
      Knowing the syntax of this language or the API of that library is useful,
      but good programmers know their DS&amp;A the way a plumber knows pipes or a musician knows scales.</p>

    <p>Our last big idea is something that artisans have known for thousands of years:
      <strong>the tool shapes the hand</strong>.
      Building software changes how you use software;
      making computers do new things changes your understanding of what computers can do.
      That's why this course asks you to create new tools as well as use pre-existing ones:
      however frustrating it may sometimes be,
      it's the only way to teach you what some people call <em>computational thinking</em>.</p>

    <p>We hope you have as much fun learning to think this way as we've had.
      Thank you for listening, and may you forever see the world with the eyes of a child.</p>

      The portion of a file's name that comes after the final "." character.
      By convention this identifies the file's type:
      <code>.txt</code> means "text file",
      <code>.png</code> means "Portable Network Graphics file",
      and so on.
      These conventions are not enforced by most operating systems:
      it is perfectly possible to name an MP3 sound file <code>homepage.html</code>.
      Since many applications use filename extensions to identify the <a href="#gloss:mime-type">MIME type</a> of the file,

    Concerns about Mars&#39;s moons on my furry friend

Author: Vlad Dracula &lt;vlad@tran.sylvan.ia&gt;
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Starting to think about Mars</span>

$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity</span></pre>

    <p>Let's run this command:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git branch moons</span></pre>

    <p>It appears to do nothing,
      but behind the scenes,
      it has created a new <a href="#gloss:branch">branch</a> called <code>moons</code>:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git branch</span>
<span class="out">* master
  moons</span></pre>

    FIXME: diagram

    <p>
      Git is now maintaining two named bookmarks in our history:
      <code>master</code>,
      which was created automatically when we set up the repository,
      and <code>moons</code>,
      which we just made.
      They both point to the same revision right now,
      but we can change that.
      Let's make <code>moons</code> the active branch:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git checkout moons</span>
<span class="out">Switched to branch 'moons'</span>
$ <span class="in">git branch</span>
<span class="out">  master
* moons</span></pre>

    <p>Our file looks the same:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cat mars.txt</span>
<span class="out">Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity</span></pre>

    <p>
      because it <em>is</em> the same:
      Git hasn't made a copy of it yet because it hasn't needed to.
      Let's add another line to it:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">echo &quot;Maybe we should put the base on one of the moons instead?&quot; &gt;&gt; mars.txt</span></pre>

    <p>and add an entirely new file:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">echo &quot;Phobos is larger than Deimos&quot; &gt; moons.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">mars.txt    moons.txt</span></pre>

    <p>Git now tells us that we have one changed file and one new file:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git status</span>
<span class="out"># On branch moons
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)

    <p>
      Let's add and commit those changes
      (the <code>-A</code> flag to <code>git commit</code> means &quot;add everything&quot;):
    </p>

      They're still in the repository&mdash;they're just not in
      the revision that <code>master</code> is currently pointing to.
      In essence,
      we've created a parallel timeline that shares some history with the original one before diverging.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's make some changes in the <code>master</code> branch to further illustrate this point:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">echo &quot;Should we go with a classical name like Ares Base?&quot; &gt; names.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">git status</span>
<span class="out"># On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
#
#    names.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</span>
$ <span class="in">git add names.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">git commit -m &quot;We will need a cool name for our secret base&quot;</span>
<span class="out">[master dfcf908] We will need a cool name for our secret base
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 names.txt</span></pre>

    <p>Our repository is now in this state:</p>

    FIXME: diagram

    <p>
      <code>master</code> and <code>moons</code> have both moved on from their original common state,
      but in different ways.
      They could continue independent existence indefinitely,
      but at some point we'll probably want to <a href="#gloss:merge">merge</a> our changes.
      Let's do that now:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git branch</span>
<span class="out">* master
  moons</span>
$ <span class="in">git merge moons</span></pre>

    <p>
      When we run the <code>git merge</code> command,
      Git opens an editor to let us write a log entry about what we're doing.
      The editor session initially contains this:
    </p>

<pre>Merge branch 'moons'

# Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
# especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.
#
# Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts
# the commit.</pre>

    <p>
      If we notice that something is wrong and decide not to complete the merge,
      we must delete everything in the file&mdash;Git interprets an empty log message to mean,
      &quot;Don't proceed.&quot;
      Otherwise,
      everything that isn't marked as a comment with <code>#</code> will be saved to the log.
      In this case,
      we'll stick with the default log message.
      When we save the file and exit the editor, Git displays this:
    </p>

<pre><span class="out">Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

    <p>We now have all of our changes in one place:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">mars.txt    moons.txt    names.txt</span></pre>

    <p>and our repository looks like this:</p>

    FIXME: diagram

    <p>
      This ASCII art is fine for small sets of changes,
      but for anything significant,
      it's much better to use a proper GUI that can draw graphs using lines instead of characters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Branching strikes most newcomers as unnecessary complexity,
      particularly for single-author projects.
      After all,
      if we need to make some changes to a project,
      what do we gain by creating parallel universes?
    </p>

    <p>
      The answer is that branching makes it easy for us to concentrate on one thing at a time.
      Suppose we are part-way through rewriting a function that calculates spatial correlations
      when we realize that the task would be easier if our file I/O routines always stored things as complex numbers.
      Most people would put the spatial correlation changes aside,
      change the file I/O,
      then (hopefully) come back to the original task.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem with this is that we have to remember what we were doing,
      even if we realize halfway through rewriting file I/O that we should also rewrite our error handling.
      It's quite common to wind up with half a dozen tasks stacked on top of one another,
      and quite hard to them all straight.
      Branching allows us to put what we're doing in a safe place,
      solve the new problem,
      then resume our earlier work.
    </p>

    <p>
      In practice,
      most developers never make changes directly in the <code>master</code> branch.
      Instead,
      they create a new branch from it for every significant change they want to make,
      then merge those branches back to <code>master</code> when the work is complete.
      Returning to our hypothetical example,
      we would:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>create a branch called something like <code>better-spatial-correlation</code> for those changes:</li>
      <li>go back to master and create another branch called <code>file-input-produces-complex-values</code> for <em>those</em> changes:</li>
      <li>merge <code>file-input-produces-complex-values</code> into <code>master</code>:</li>
      <li>merge <code>master</code> into <code>better-spatial-correlation</code>:</li>
      <li>and then finish work on the spatial correlation function and merge it all back into <code>master</code>:</li>
    </ol>


    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      And if,
      partway through this process,
      our supervisor asked us to change the graph-plotting routines to conform to the university's new style guide,
      we would simply switch back to <code>master</code>,
      create a branch for that,
      make the changes,
      produce the desired graphs,
      and leave the changes parked in that branch until we were ready to merge them.
    </p>

    <h3>Code Review</h3>

    <p>
      The model shown above,
      in which everyone pushes and pulls from a single repository,
      is perfectly usable,
      but there's one thing it <em>doesn't</em> let us do,
      and that's <a href="#gloss:code-review">code review</a>.
      Suppose Dracula wants to be able to look at Wolfman's changes before merging them into the master copy on GitHub,
      just as he would review Wolfman's paper before publishing it
      (or perhaps even before submitting it for publication).
      We need to arrange things so that Wolfman can commit his changes and Dracula can compare them with the master copy;
      in fact,
      we want Wolfman to be able to commit many times,
      so that he can incorporate Dracula's feedback and get further review as often as necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      To allow code review,
      most programmers take a slightly more roundabout route to merging.
      When the project starts,
      Dracula creates a repository on GitHub
      in exactly the same way as we created the <code>planets</code> repository a few moments ago,
      and then <a href="#gloss:repository-clone">clones</a> it to his desktop:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">git clone https://github.com/vlad/undersea.git</span>
<span class="out">Cloning into 'undersea'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.</span></pre>

    <p>
      <code>git clone</code> automatically adds the original repository on GitHub
      as a remote of the local repository called <code>origin</code>&mdash;this is why
      we chose <code>origin</code> as a remote name in our previous example:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">cd undersea</span>
$ <span class="in">git remote -v</span>
<span class="out">origin https://github.com/vlad/undersea.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/vlad/undersea.git (push)</span></pre>

    <p>Dracula can now push and pull changes just as before.</p>

    <p>
      Wolfman doesn't clone Dracula's GitHub repository directly.
      Instead,
      he <a href="#gloss:fork-repository">forks</a> it,
      i.e., clones it on GitHub. He does this using the GitHub web interface:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: screenshot</p>

    <p>He then clones his GitHub repository, not Dracula's, to give himself a desktop copy:</p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      This may seem like unnecessary work,
      but it allows Wolfman and Dracula to collaborate much more effectively.
      Suppose Wolfman makes a change to the project.
      He commits it to his local repository,
      then uses <code>git push</code> to copy those changes to GitHub:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      He then creates a <a href="#gloss:pull-request">pull request</a>,
      which notifies Dracula that Wolfman wants to merge some changes into Dracula's repository:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: screenshot</p>

    <p>
      A pull request is a merge waiting to happen.
      When Dracula views it online,
      he can see and comment on the changes Wolfman wants to make:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: screenshot</p>

    <p>
      Commenting is the crucial step here,
      and half the reason Wolfman went to the trouble of forking the repository on GitHub.
      Dracula,
      or anyone else involved in the project,
      can now give Wolfman feedback on what he is trying to do:
      this function is too long,
      that one contains a bug,
      there's a special case that isn't being handled anywhere,
      and so on.
      Wolfman can then update his code,
      commit locally,
      and push those changes to GitHub to update the pull request:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      This process is exactly like peer review of papers, though usually much faster.
      In large open source projects like Firefox,
      it's very common for a pull request to be updated several times before finally being accepted and merged.
      Working this way not only helps maintain the quality of the code,
      it is also a very effective way to transfer knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      What happens if Wolfman wants to do more work while he's waiting for Dracula to review his first modification?
      Simple: he creates a new branch in his local repository,
      pushes it to GitHub, and then issues a pull request from that:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      We can now see why Git, Mercurial, and other modern version control systems use branching so much:
      it helps people work together,
      but on their own time.
      It might take Dracula several days to get around to reviewing Wolfman's changes.
      Rather than being stalled until then,
      Wolfman can just switch to another branch and work on something else,
      then switch back when Dracula's review finally comes in.
      Once the changes in a particular branch have been accepted,
      Wolfman can delete it; provided it has been merged into <code>master</code> (or some other branch),
      the only thing that will be lost is the pointer with the branch name,
      not the changes themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      We said above that code review is half the reason every developer should have their own repository on GitHub
      (or whatever service is being used).
      The other reason is that working this way allows people to explore ideas
      without needing permission from any central authority.
      If you want to change this tutorial,
      you can fork the <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">Software Carpentry repository on GitHub</a>
      and start rewriting things in your repository.
      You can send us a pull request if you want to share you changes with us,
      but you don't have to.
      And if other people like your version better than ours,
      they can start forking your repository and sending pull requests to you instead of to us.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this sounds familiar, it's because it is the way science itself works.
      When someone publishes a new method or result,
      other scientists can immediately start building on top of it&mdash;essentially,
      they can create their own fork of the work and start committing changes to it.
      If the first scientist likes the second's work,
      she can incorporate those findings into her next paper,
      which is analogous to merging a pull request.
      If she doesn't,
      then it's up to other scientists to decide whose work to build on,
      or whether to try to combine both approaches.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>

    <p>
      It's now time to look at how Unix determines who can see the contents of which files,
      who can <em>change</em> those files,
      and who can run particular programs.
      We will skip over many of the details,
      as most people only need to know 10% of what Unix does
      to accomplish every day-to-day task.
      We will also defer discussion of Windows until the end of the section:
      its concepts are similar,
      but its rules are different,
      and unfortunately there's no exact mapping between those rules and the ones Unix uses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's start with Nelle.
      She has a unique <a href="#gloss:user-name">user name</a>,
      which is <code>nnemo</code>,
      and a <a href="#gloss:user-id">user ID</a>,
      which is 1404.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Why Integer IDs?</h3>

      <p>
        Why integers for IDs?
        Again, the answer goes back to the early 1970s.
        Character strings like <code>alan.turing</code> are of varying length,
        and comparing one to another takes many instructions.
        Integers,
        on the other hand,
        use a fairly small amount of storage (typically as much as four characters),
        and can be compared with a single instruction.
        To make operations fast and simple,
        programmers often keep track of things internally using integers,
        then use a <a href="setdict.html">lookup table</a> of some kind
        to translate those integers into user-friendly text for presentation.
        Of course,
        programmers being programmers,
        they will often skip the user-friendly string part
        and just use the integers,
        in the same way that someone working in a lab might talk about Experiment 28
        instead of "the chronotypical alpha-response trials on anacondas".
      </p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Users can belong to any number of <a href="#gloss:user-group">groups</a>,
      each of which has a unique <a href="#gloss:user-group-name">group name</a>
      and numeric <a href="#gloss:user-group-id">group ID</a>.
      The list of who's in what group is usually stored in the file <code>/etc/group</code>.
      (If you're in front of a Unix machine right now,
      try running <code>cat /etc/group</code> to look at that file.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let's look at files and directories.
      Along with each file's content,
      the operating system stores the numeric IDs of the user and group that own it.
      These values are <em>not</em> stored in the file itself,
      but separately in space on the disk reserved for the operating system's use.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user-and-group model means that
      every user on the system falls into one of three categories:
      the owner of the file,
      someone else who is in the file's group,
      and everyone else.
      For each of these three categories,
      the computer keeps track of
      whether people in that category can read the file,
      whether they can write to it,
      and whether they can execute it
      (i.e., run it if it is a program).
      We can visualize all of this as a 3&times;3 table:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr><td></td><td>user</td><td>group</td><td>all</td></tr>
      <tr><td>read</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
      <tr><td>write</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
      <tr><td>execute</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Together, these permissions mean that:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        the file's owner can read and write it, but not run it;
      </li>
      <li>
        other people in the file's owning group can read it, but not modify it; and
      </li>
      <li>
        nobody else can do anything with it at all.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Let's look at this model in action.
      If we <code>cd</code> into the <code>labs</code> directory and run <code>ls -F</code>,
      it puts a <code>*</code> at the end of <code>setup</code>'s name.
      This is its way of telling us that <code>setup</code> is executable,
      i.e.,
      that it's (probably) something the computer can run.
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd labs</span>
$ <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">safety.txt    setup*     waiver.txt</span>
$
</pre>

    <blockquote class="box">
      <h3>Necessary But Not Sufficient</h3>

      <p>
        The fact that something is marked as executable
        doesn't actually mean it contains a program of some kind.
        We could easily mark this HTML file as executable
        using the commands that are introduced <a href="#a:chmod">below</a>.
        Depending on the operating system we're using,
        trying to "run" it will either fail
        (because it doesn't contain instructions the computer recognizes)
        or cause the operating system to open the file
        with whatever application usually handles it
        (such as a web browser).
      </p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Now let's run the command <code>ls -l</code>:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -l</span>
<span class="out">-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  1158  2010-07-11 08:22 safety.txt

-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  2312  2010-07-11 08:23 waiver.txt</span>
$
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      The <code>-l</code> flag tells <code>ls</code> to give us a long-form listing.
      It's a lot of information, so let's go through the columns in turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the right side, we have the files' and directories' names.
      Next to them,
      moving left,
      are the times they were last modified.
      Backup systems and other tools use this information in a variety of ways that we'll explore in a later lecture,
      but you can use it right away to tell which files are younger or older than which others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next to the modification time is the file's size in bytes.
      Next to that is the ID of the group that owns it,
      and of the user that owns it.
      We'll skip over the second column for now,
      because it's the column on the left that we care about most.
      This shows the file's permissions, i.e., who can read, write, or execute it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's have a closer look at one of those permission strings:
      <code>-rwxr-xr-x</code>.
      The first character tells us what type of thing this is.
      '-' means it's a regular file, while 'd' means it's a directory.
      The next three characters tell us what permissions the file's owner has.
      Here, the owner can read, write, and execute the file.
      The middle triplet shows us the group's permissions.
      If the permission is turned off, we see a dash, so 'r-x' means "read and execute, but not write".
      The final triplet shows us what everyone who isn't the file's owner, or in the file's group, can do.
      In this case, it's 'r-x' again, so everyone on the system can look at the file's contents and run it.
    </p>

    <p>
      So much for looking at permissions:
      to change them, we use the <code>chmod</code> command.
      (The name stands for "change mode",
      which once again isn't particularly memorable.)
      Here's a long-form listing showing the permissions on the final grades in the course Vlad is teaching:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -l final.grd</span>
<span class="out">-rwxrwxrwx 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-29 22:30 final.grd</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      Whoops: everyone in the world can read it.
      And what's worse, modify it&mdash;crafty students could go in and change their grades.
      (They could also try to run the grades file as a program,
      which would almost certainly not work.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The command to change the owner's permissions to 'rw-' is:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">chmod u=rw final.grd</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      The 'u' signals that we're changing the privileges of the user (i.e., the file's owner),
      and 'rw' is the new set of permissions.
      A quick <code>ls -l</code> shows us that it worked,
      because the owner's permissions are now set to read and write:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -l final.grd</span>
<span class="out">-rw-rwxrwx 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-30 08:19 final.grd</span>
$
</pre>

    <p>
      Let's run <code>chmod</code> again to give the group read-only permission:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">chmod g=r final.grd</span>
$ <span class="in">ls -l final.grd</span>
<span class="out">-rw-r--rw- 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-30 08:19 final.grd</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      And finally,
      let's give "all" (everyone on the system who isn't the file's owner or in its group) no permissions at all:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">chmod a= final.grd</span>
$ <span class="in">ls -l final.grd</span>
<span class="out">-rw-r----- 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-30 08:20 final.grd</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      That's what "a=" means:
      the 'a' signals that we're changing permissions for "all",
      and since there's nothing on the right of the "=",
      "all"'s new permissions are empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can search by permissions, too.
      Here, for example, we can use <code>-type&nbsp;f -perm&nbsp;-u=x</code> to find files
      that the user can execute:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -type f -perm -u=x</span>
<span class="out">./tools/format
./tools/stats</span>
$
</pre>

    <p>
      Before we go any further,
      let's run <code>ls -a -l</code>
      to get a long-form listing that includes directory entries that are normally hidden:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ls -a -l</span>
<span class="out">drwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio     0  2010-08-14 09:55 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio  8192  2010-08-27 23:11 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  1158  2010-07-11 08:22 safety.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio 31988  2010-07-23 20:04 setup
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  2312  2010-07-11 08:23 waiver.txt</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      The permissions for <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> (this directory and its parent) start with a 'd'.
      But look at the rest of their permissions:
      the 'x' means that "execute" is turned on.
      What does that mean?
      A directory isn't a program&mdash;how can we "run" it?
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, 'x' means something different for directories.
      It gives someone the right to <em>traverse</em> the directory, but not to look at its contents.
      The distinction is subtle, so let's have a look at an example.
      Vlad's home directory has three subdirectories called <code>venus</code>, <code>mars</code>, and <code>pluto</code>:
    </p>

    <p><img src="appendix/bash/img/x-for-directories.svg" alt="Execute Permission for Directories" /></p>

    <p>
      Each of these has a subdirectory in turn called <code>notes</code>,
      and those sub-subdirectories contain various files.
      If a user's permissions on <code>venus</code> are 'r-x',
      then if she tries to see the contents of <code>venus</code> and <code>venus/notes</code> using <code>ls</code>,
      the computer lets her see both.
      If her permissions on <code>mars</code> are just 'r--',
      then she is allowed to read the contents of both <code>mars</code> and <code>mars/notes</code>.
      But if her permissions on <code>pluto</code> are only '--x',
      she cannot see what's in the <code>pluto</code> directory:
      <code>ls pluto</code> will tell her she doesn't have permission to view its contents.
      If she tries to look in <code>pluto/notes</code>, though, the computer will let her do that.
      She's allowed to go through <code>pluto</code>, but not to look at what's there.
      This trick gives people a way to make some of their directories visible to the world as a whole
      without opening up everything else.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those are the basics of permissions on Unix.
      As we said at the outset, though, things work differently on Windows.
      There, permissions are defined by <a href="#gloss:access-control-list">access control lists</a>, or ACLs.
      An ACL is a list of pairs, each of which combines a "who" with a "what".
      For example,
      you could give the Mummy permission to append data to a file without giving him permission to read or delete it,
      and give Frankenstein permission to delete a file without being able to see what it contains.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is more flexible that the Unix model,
      but it's also more complex to administer and understand on small systems.
      (If you have a large computer system,
      <em>nothing</em> is easy to administer or understand.)
      Some modern variants of Unix support ACLs as well as the older read-write-execute permissions,
      but hardly anyone uses them.
    </p>

    <h2>Process Control</h2>

    <p>
      Our next topic is how to control programs <em>once they're running</em>.
      This is called <a href="#gloss:job-control">job control</a>,
      and while it's less important today than it was back in the Dark Ages,
      it is coming back into its own as more people begin to leverage the power of computer networks.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we talk about controlling programs,
      what we really mean is controlling <em>processes</em>.
      As we said earlier, a process is just a program that's in memory and executing.
      Some of the processes on your computer are yours:
      they're running programs you explicitly asked for, like your web browser.
      Many others belong to the operating system that manages your computer for you, or, if you're on a shared machine, to other users.
      You can use the <code>ps</code> command to list them, just as you use <code>ls</code> to list files and directories:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ps</span>
<span class="out">PID    PPID   PGID   TTY   UID     STIME   COMMAND
2152      1   2152   con  1000  13:19:07   /usr/bin/bash
2276   2152   2276   con  1000  14:53:48   /usr/bin/ps</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      Every process has a unique process id (PID).
      Remember, this is a property of the process, not of the program that process is executing:
      if you are running three instances of your browser at once, each will have its own process ID.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second column in this listing, PPID, shows the ID of each process's parent.
      Every process on a computer is spawned by another, which is its parent
      (except, of course, for the bootstrap process that runs automatically when the computer starts up).
    </p>

    <p>
      The third column (labelled PGID) is the ID of the <em>process group</em> this process belongs to.
      We won't discuss process groups in this lecture,
      but they're often used to manage sets of related processes.
      Column 4 shows the ID of the terminal this process is running in.
      Once upon a time, this really would have been a terminal connected to a central timeshared computer.
      It isn't as important these days, except that if a process is a system service, such as a network monitor,
      <code>ps</code> will display a question mark for its terminal, since it doesn't actually have one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Column 5 is more interesting: it's the user ID of the user this process is being run by.
      This is the user ID the computer uses when checking permissions:
      the process is allowed to access exactly the same things as the user, no more, no less.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, Column 6 shows when the process started running,
      and Column 7 shows what program the process is executing.
      Your version of <code>ps</code> may show more or fewer columns,
      or may show them in a different order,
      but the same information is generally available everywhere.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>
      The shell is just a program, and like other programs, it has variables.
      Those variables control its execution,
      and by changing their values,
      you can change how the shell and other programs behave.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's start by running the command <code>set</code> and looking at some of the variables in a typical shell session:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">set</span>
<span class="out">COMPUTERNAME=TURING
HOME=/home/vlad
HOMEDRIVE=C:
HOSTNAME=TURING
HOSTTYPE=i686
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=4
OS=Windows_NT
PATH=/Users/gwilson/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
PWD=/home/vlad
UID=1000
USERNAME=vlad
...</span></pre>

    <p>
      As you can see, there are quite a few&mdash;in fact, four or five times more than what's shown here.
      And yes,
      using <code>set</code> to <em>show</em> things might seem a little strange,
      even for Unix,
      but if you don't give it any arguments,
      it might as well show you things you <em>could</em> set.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every variable has a name.
      By convention, variables that are always present are given upper-case names.
      All shell variables' values are strings, even those (like <code>UID</code>) that look like numbers.
      it's up to programs to convert these strings to other types when necessary.
      For example, if a program wanted to find out how many processors the computer had,
      it would convert the value of the <code>NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS</code> variable from a string to an integer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, some variables (like <code>PATH</code>) store lists of values.
      In this case, the convention is to use a colon ':' as a separator.
      If a program wants the individual elements of such a list,
      it's the program's responsibility to split the variable's string value into pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's have a closer look at that <code>PATH</code> variable.
      Its value defines the shell's <a href="#gloss:search-path">search path</a>,
      i.e., the directories that the shell looks in for runnable programs.
      If you recall, when we type a command like <code>./analyze</code> that has a specific directory in the path,
      the shell runs the program that path specifies.
      Similarly, if we type <code>/bin/analyze</code>, the shell runs that specific program:
      we've provided a specific path, so it knows what to do.
      But which one should the shell do if we just type <code>analyze</code>?
    </p>

    <p>
      The rule is simple:
      the shell checks each directory in the <code>PATH</code> variable in turn,
      looking for a program with the requested name in that directory.
      As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and runs the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      To show how this works, here are the components of <code>PATH</code> broken out one per line:
    </p>

<pre>
/Users/gwilson/bin
/usr/local/git/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/usr/local/bin
</pre>

    <p>
      On our computer, there are actually three programs called <code>analyze</code> in three different directories:
      <code>/bin/analyze</code>, <code>/usr/local/bin/analyze</code>, and <code>/users/vlad/analyze</code>.
      Since the shell searches the directories in order, it finds the one in <code>/bin</code>, not either of the others.
      Notice that it will <em>never</em> find the program <code>/users/vlad/analyze</code>,
      since the directory <code>/users/vlad</code> isn't in our path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's show the value of the variable <code>HOME</code>:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">echo HOME</span>
<span class="out">HOME</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      That just prints "HOME", which isn't what we wanted.
      Let's try this instead: <code>echo $HOME</code>:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">echo $HOME</span>
<span class="out">/home/vlad</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      The dollar sign tells the shell to replace the variable's name with its value.
      This works just like wildcards:
      the shell does the replacement <em>before</em> running the program we've asked for.
      Thanks to this expansion, what we actually run is <code>echo /home/vlad</code>,
      which displays the right thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating a variable is easy: just assign a value to a name using "=":
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula</span>
$ <span class="in">echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
<span class="out">Dracula</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      To change the value, just assign a new one:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">SECRET_IDENTITY=Camilla</span>
$ <span class="in">echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
<span class="out">Camilla</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      If we want to set some variables' values automatically every time we run a shell,
      we can put the command to do this in a file called <code>.bashrc</code> in our home directory.
      (The '.' character at the front prevents <code>ls</code> from listing this file
      unless we specifically ask it to using <code>-a</code>:
      we normally don't want to worry about it.
      The "rc" at the end is an abbreviation for "run control",
      which meant something really important decades ago,
      and is now just a convention everyone follows without understanding why.)
      For example, here are two lines in Vlad's <code>.bashrc</code> file,
      which is in <code>/home/vlad/.bashrc</code>:
    </p>

<pre>
export SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
export TEMP_DIR=/tmp
export BACKUP_DIR=$TEMP_DIR/backup
</pre>

    <p>
      These two lines create the variables <code>SECRET_IDENTITY</code> and <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>,
      give them values,
      and export them so that any programs the shell runs can see them as well.
      Notice that <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>'s definition relies on the value of <code>TEMP_DIR</code>,
      so that if we change where we put temporary files,
      our backups will be relocated automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      While we're here,
      it's also common to use the <code>alias</code> command to create shortcuts for things we frequently type.
      For example, we can define the alias <code>backup</code>
      to run <code>/bin/zback</code> with a specific set of arguments:
    </p>

<pre>
alias backup=/bin/zback -v --nostir -R 20000 $HOME $BACKUP_DIR
</pre>

    <p>
      As you can see, aliases can save us a lot of typing, and hence a lot of typing mistakes.
    </p>

    <h2>Working Remotely</h2>

    <p>
      Let's take a closer look at what happens when we use a desktop or laptop computer.
      The first step is to log in
      so that the operating system knows who we are and what we're allowed to do.
      We do this by typing our username and password;
      the operating system checks those values against its records,
      and if they match,
      runs a shell for us.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we type commands,
      the 1's and 0's that represent the characters we're typing are sent from the keyboard to the shell.
      The shell displays those characters on the screen to represent what we type,
      and then,
      if what we typed was a command,
      the shell executes it and displays its output (if any).
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      What if we want to run some commands on another machine,
      such as the server in the basement that manages our database of experimental results?
      To do this,
      we have to first log in to that machine.
      We call this a <a href="#gloss:remote-login">remote login</a>,
      and the other computer a remote computer.
      Once we do this,
      everything we type is passed to a shell running on the remote computer.
      That shell interacts runs those commands on our behalf,
      just as a local shell would,
      then sends back output for our computer to display:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      The tool we use to log in remotely is the <a href="#gloss:secure-shell">secure shell</a>, or SSH.
      In particular, the command <code>ssh username@computer</code>
      runs SSH and connects to the remote computer we have specified.
      After we log in,
      we can use the remote shell to use the remote computer's files and directories.
      Typing <code>exit</code> or <span class="in">Control-D</span>
      terminates the remote shell and returns us to our previous shell.
      In the example below, we use highlighting to show our interaction with the remote shell.
      We can also see that the remote machine's command prompt is <code>moon&gt;</code>
      instead of just <code>$</code>:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$ <span class="in">ssh vlad@moon.euphoric.edu</span>
Password:<span class="in"> ********</span>
moon&gt; <span class="in">hostname</span>
<span class="out">moon</span>
moon&gt; <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/home/vlad</span>
moon&gt; <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">bin/     cheese.txt   dark_side/   rocks.cfg</span>
moon&gt; <span class="in">exit</span>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      The secure shell is called "secure" to contrast it with an older program called <code>rsh</code>,
      which stood for "remote shell".
      Back in the day,
      when everyone trusted each other and knew every chip in their computer by its first name,
      people didn't encrypt anything except the most sensitive information when sending it over a network.
      However,
      that meant that villains could watch network traffic,
      steal usernames and passwords,
      and use them for all manner of nefarious purposes.
      SSH was invented to prevent this (or at least slow it down).
      It uses several sophisticated, and heavily tested, encryption protocols
      to ensure that outsiders can't see what's in the messages
      going back and forth between different computers.
      A <a href="security.html">later chapter</a> will talk about how this works,
      and how secure it really is.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>ssh</code> has a companion program called <code>scp</code>,
      which stands for "secure copy".
      It allows us to copy files to or from a remote computer using the same kind of connection as SSH.
      The syntax is a simple mix of <code>cp</code>'s and <code>ssh</code>'s.
      To copy a file,
      we specify the source and destination paths,
      either of which may include computer names.
      If we leave out a computer name,
      <code>scp</code> assumes we mean the machine we're running on.
      For example,
      this command copies our latest results to the backup server in the basement,
      printing out its progress as it does so:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">scp results.dat vlad@backupserver:backups/results-2011-11-11.dat</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
<span class="out">results.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      Copying a whole directory is similar:
      we just use the <code>-r</code> option to signal that we want copying to be recursive.
      For example,
      this command copies all of our results from the backup server to our laptop:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">scp -r vlad@backupserver:backups ./backups</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-09-18.dat              100%  7  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-10-04.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-10-28.dat              100%  8  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-11-11.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
$
</pre>

    <p>
      To close off this chapter,
      let's look at one more thing SSH can do for us.
      Suppose we want to check whether we have already created the file
      <code>backups/results-2011-11-12.dat</code> on the backup server.
      Instead of logging in and then typing <code>ls</code>,
      we could do this:
    </p>

<pre>$ <span class="in">ssh vlad@backupserver ls results</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-09-18.dat  results-2011-10-28.dat
results-2011-10-04.dat  results-2011-11-11.dat</span>
$</pre>

    <p>
      SSH has taken the arguments after our username and the name of the computer we want to run on
      and passed them to the shell on the remote computer.
      Since those arguments are a legal command,
      the remote shell has run <code>ls results</code> for us
      and sent the output back to our local shell for display.
    </p>

    <h2>Aliasing</h2>

    <p>
      At this point,
      we need to take a small side trip to explore something which is very useful,
      but which can also be the source of some hard-to-find bugs.
      Consider the following snippet of Python:
    </p>

<pre><span class="in">outer = [ [10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60] ]
inner = outer[0]</span></pre>

    <p>
      After these two lines have been executed,
      the program's memory looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      <code>outer</code> refers to a two-element list
      containing references to a couple of three-element lists,
      while <code>inner</code> refers to the first of those three-element lists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let's change the last value of the list that <code>inner</code> refers to:
    </p>

<pre><span class="in">inner[2] = 99</span></pre>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      This changes memory as shown above,
      which means that the values of both <code>inner</code> <em>and</em> <code>outer</code>
      have changed:
    </p>

<pre><span class="in">print inner</span>
<span class="out">[10, 20, 99]</span>
<span class="in">print outer</span>
<span class="out">[[10, 20, 99], [40, 50, 60]]</span></pre>

    <p>
      This is called <a href="glossary.html#alias">aliasing</a>.
      It is not a bug:
      the program is supposed to work this way.
      It doesn't have to, though;
      Python's creator could have decided that:
    </p>

<pre><span class="in">inner = outer[0]</span></pre>

    <p>
      would create a copy of <code>outer[0]</code>
      and assign that to <code>inner</code>
      rather than aliasing the first element of <code>outer</code>.
      That would be easier to understand&mdash;there would be no chance that
      assigning to one variable would cause another variable's value to change&mdash;but
      it would also be less efficient.
      If our sublists contain a million elements each,
      and we're assigning them to temporary variables
      simply to make our program more readable,
      copying would cause unnecessary slow-down.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a programming language copies data,
      and when it creates aliases instead,
      is one of the most important things a programmer must know about it.
      If we query a database,
      is the result a copy of the data as it was when we made the query,
      or a reference to the master copy?
      In the first case,
      we can now change the data however we want without affecting other people,
      but we won't see any updates they make.
      In the second case,
      we will automatically see updates to the data,
      but that means our program has to cope with changes at unpredictable times
      (and also has to re-fetch the data each time it needs it,
      which will reduce performance).
      Neither approach is right or wrong:
      there are simply engineering tradeoffs that we have to be aware of.
    </p>

      <h3>Copying When You Want To</h3>

      <p>
        Python has a library called (naturally enough) <code>copy</code>
        that knows how to copy complex data structures.
        We will take a look at it <a href="#a:copy_library">later</a>
        once we have looked at how Python manages libraries in general.

    <p>
      We said earlier that
      values are copied into parameters whenever a function is called.
      But variables don't actually store values:
      they are actually just names that refer to values.
      To see what this means for our programs,
      here's a function that takes a string and a list as parameters,
      and appends something to both:
    </p>

<pre><span class="in">def appender(a_string, a_list):
    a_string = a_string + 'turing'
    a_list.append('turing')</span></pre>

    <p>
      And here is some code to set up a pair of variables and call that function:
    </p>

<pre><span class="in">string_val = 'alan'
list_val = ['alan']
appender(string_val, list_val)
print 'string', string_val
print 'list', list_val</span>
<span class="out">string alan
list ['alan', 'turing']</span></pre>

    <p>
      Why did the list change when the string didn't?
      To find out,
      let's trace the function's execution.
      Just before the call,
      the global frame has two variables
      that refer to a string and a list:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      The call creates a new stack frame with aliases for those values:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      The <code>a_string + 'turing'</code> creates a new string <code>'alanturing'</code>;
      assigning this to the variable <code>a_string</code>
      changes what that local variable refers to,
      but doesn't change what the global variable <code>string_val</code> refers to:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      The statement <code>a_list.append('turing')</code>,
      however,
      actually modifies the list that <code>a_list</code> is pointing to:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      But this is the same thing that the variable <code>list_val</code> in the caller is pointing to.
      When the function returns and the call frame is thrown away,
      the new string <code>'alanturing'</code> is therefore lost,
      because the only reference to it was in the function call's stack frame.
      The change to the list,
      on the other hand,
      is kept,
      because the function actually modified the list in place:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      Let's change one line in the function:
    </p>

<pre><span class="in">def appender(a_string, a_list):
    a_string = a_string + 'turing'
    a_list = a_list + ['turing']</span></pre>

    <p>
      and see what happens when we run the same experiment:
    </p>

<pre><span class="in">string_val = 'alan'
list_val = ['alan']
appender(string_val, list_val)
print 'string', string_val
print 'list', list_val</span>
<span class="out">string alan
list ['alan']</span></pre>

    <p>
      The answer is different because
      concatenating (adding) two lists creates a new list,
      rather than modifying either of the lists being concatenated.
      As a result,
      the local variable <code>a_list</code> is the only thing that refers to the list
      <code>['alan', 'turing']</code>,
      so that value is discarded when the function finishes
      and <code>list_val</code>'s value is undisturbed.
    </p>

      <h3>Memory Models</h3>

      <p>
        Python's treatment of lists
        (and other mutable data that we'll see <a href="setdict.html">later</a>)
        isn't the only way to handle things.
        For example,
        MATLAB functions
        use a rule called <a href="glossary.html#copy-on-write">copy on write</a>.
        Initially,
        it creates aliases for arrays that are passed into functions.
        The first time a function assigns to an array,
        though,
        MATLAB clones the array
        and changes the clone rather than the original.
        This saves it from copying data when it doesn't need to,
        while guaranteeing that functions don't have side effects
        (which makes them easier to think about).
      </p>

      <p>
        Other languages have slightly different rules about scoping and aliasing.
        Together,
        those rules make up the language's
        <a href="glossary.html#memory-model">memory model</a>.
        Understanding that model is perhaps the most important step
        in understanding how programs written in the language actually work,
        and more importantly,
        how to debug them when they don't.
      </p>

    <h2>Exceptions</h2>

    <p>Assertions help us catch errors in our code,
      but things can go wrong for other reasons,
      like missing or badly-formatted files.
      Most modern programming languages allow programmers to use
      <a href="../../gloss.html#exception">exceptions</a> to separate
      what the program should do if everything goes right
      from what it should do if something goes wrong.
      Doing this makes both cases easier to read and understand.</p>

    <p>For example,
      here's a small piece of code that tries to read parameters and a grid from two
      separate files,
      and reports an error if either goes wrong:</p>

<pre><span class="in">try:
    params = read_params(param_file)
    grid = read_grid(grid_file)
except:
    log.error('Failed to read input file(s)')
    sys.exit(ERROR)</span></pre>

    <p>We join the normal case and the error-handling code using the keywords <code>try</code> and
      <code>except</code>.
      These work together like <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>:
      the statements under the <code>try</code> are what should happen if everything works,
      while the statements under <code>except</code> are what the program should do if something
      goes wrong.</p>

    <p>We have actually seen exceptions before without knowing it,
      since by default,
      when an exception occurs,
      Python prints it out and halts our program.
      For example,
      trying to open a nonexistent file triggers a type of exception called an
      <code>IOError</code>,
      while trying to access a list element that doesn't exist
      causes an <code>IndexError</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="in">open('nonexistent-file.txt', 'r')</span>
<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IOError                                   Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-13-58cbde3dd63c&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 open('nonexistent-file.txt', 'r')

IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'nonexistent-file.txt'</span>

<span class="in">values = [0, 1, 2]
print values[999]</span>

<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-14-7fed13afc650&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
      1 values = [0, 1, 2]
----&gt; 2 print values[999]

IndexError: list index out of range</span></pre>

    <p>We can use <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> to deal with these errors ourselves
      if we don't want the program simply to fall over:</p>

<pre><span class="in">try:
    reader = open('nonexistent-file.txt', 'r')
except IOError:
    print 'Whoops!'</span>
<span class="err">Whoops!</span></pre>

    <p>When Python executes this code,
      it runs the statement inside the <code>try</code>.
      If that works, it skips over the <code>except</code> block without running it.
      If an exception occurs inside the <code>try</code> block,
      though,
      Python compares the type of the exception to the type specified by the <code>except</code>.
      If they match, it executes the code in the <code>except</code> block.</p>

    <p><code>IOError</code> is the particular kind of exception Python raises
      when there is a problem related to input and output,
      such as files not existing
      or the program not having the permissions it needs to read them.
      We can put as many lines of code in a <code>try</code> block as we want,
      just as we can put many statements under an <code>if</code>.
      We can also handle several different kinds of errors afterward.
      For example,
      here's some code to calculate the entropy at each point in a grid:</p>

<pre><span class="in">python
try:
    params = read_params(param_file)
    grid = read_grid(grid_file)
    entropy = lee_entropy(params, grid)
    write_entropy(entropy_file, entropy)
except IOError:
    report_error_and_exit('IO error')
except ArithmeticError:
    report_error_and_exit('Arithmetic error')</span></pre>

    <p>Python tries to run the four functions inside the <code>try</code> as normal.
      If an error occurs in any of them,
      Python immediately jumps down
      and tries to find an <code>except</code> of the corresponding type:
      if the exception is an <code>IOError</code>,
      Python jumps into the first error handler,
      while if it's an <code>ArithmeticError</code>,
      Python jumps into the second handler instead.
      It will only execute one of these,
      just as it will only execute one branch
      of a series of <code>if</code>/<code>elif</code>/<code>else</code> statements.</p>

    <p>This layout has made the code easier to read,
      but we've lost something important:
      the message printed out by the <code>IOError</code> branch doesn't tell us
      which file caused the problem.
      We can do better if we capture and hang on to the object that Python creates
      to record information about the error:</p>

<pre><span class="in">python
try:
    params = read_params(param_file)
    grid = read_grid(grid_file)
    entropy = lee_entropy(params, grid)
    write_entropy(entropy_file, entropy)
except IOError as err:
    report_error_and_exit('Cannot read/write' + err.filename)
except ArithmeticError as err:
    report_error_and_exit(err.message)</span></pre>

    <p>If something goes wrong in the <code>try</code>,
      Python creates an exception object,
      fills it with information,
      and assigns it to the variable <code>err</code>.
      (There's nothing special about this variable name&mdash;we can use anything we
      want.)
      Exactly what information is recorded depends on what kind of error occurred;
      Python's documentation describes the properties of each type of error in detail,
      but we can always just print the exception object.
      In the case of an I/O error,
      we print out the name of the file that caused the problem.
      And in the case of an arithmetic error,
      printing out the message embedded in the exception object is what Python would
      have done anyway.</p>

    <p>So much for how exceptions work:
      how should they be used?
      Some programmers use <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> to give their programs default
      behaviors.
      For example,
      if this code can't read the grid file that the user has asked for,
      it creates a default grid instead:</p>

<pre><span class="in">python
try:
    grid = read_grid(grid_file)
except IOError:
    grid = default_grid()</span></pre>

    <p>Other programmers would explicitly test for the grid file,
      and use <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> for control flow:</p>

<pre><span class="in">python
if file_exists(grid_file):
    grid = read_grid(grid_file)
else:
    grid = default_grid()</span></pre>

    <p>It's mostly a matter of taste,
      but we prefer the second style.
      As a rule,
      exceptions should only be used to handle exceptional cases.
      If the program knows how to fall back to a default grid,
      that's not an unexpected event.
      Using <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>
      instead of <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>
      sends different signals to anyone reading our code,
      even if they do the same thing.</p>

    <p>Novices often ask another question about exception handling style as well,
      but before we address it,
      there's something in our example that you might not have noticed.
      Exceptions can actually be thrown a long way:
      they don't have to be handled immediately.
      Take another look at this code:</p>

<pre><span class="in">python
try:
    params = read_params(param_file)
    grid = read_grid(grid_file)
    entropy = lee_entropy(params, grid)
    write_entropy(entropy_file, entropy)
except IOError as err:
    report_error_and_exit('Cannot read/write' + err.filename)
except ArithmeticError as err:
    report_error_and_exit(err.message)</span></pre>

    <p>The four lines in the <code>try</code> block are all function calls.
      They might catch and handle exceptions themselves,
      but if an exception occurs in one of them that <em>isn't</em> handled internally,
      Python looks in the calling code for a matching <code>except</code>.
      If it doesn't find one there,
      it looks in that function's caller,
      and so on.
      If we get all the way back to the main program without finding an exception
      handler,
      Python's default behavior is to print an error message like the ones we've been
      seeing all along.</p>

    <p>This rule is the origin of the saying
      <a href="#rule:throw-low-catch-high">throw low, catch high</a>.
      There are many places in our program where an error might occur.
      There are only a few, though, where errors can sensibly be handled.
      For example,
      a linear algebra library doesn't know whether it's being called directly from
      the Python interpreter,
      or whether it's being used as a component in a larger program.
      In the latter case,
      the library doesn't know if the program that's calling it is being run from the
      command line or from a GUI.
      The library therefore shouldn't try to handle or report errors itself,
      because it has no way of knowing what the right way to do this is.
      It should instead just raise an exception,
      and let its caller figure out how best to handle it.</p>

    <p>Finally,
      we can raise exceptions ourselves if we want to.
      In fact,
      we <em>should</em> do this,
      since it's the standard way in Python to signal that something has gone wrong.
      Here,
      for example,
      is a function that reads a grid and checks its consistency:</p>

<pre>def read_grid(grid_file):

    data = read_raw_data(grid_file)
    if not grid_consistent(data):
        raise Exception('Inconsistent grid: ' + grid_file)
    result = normalize_grid(data)

    return result</pre>

    <p>The <code>raise</code> statement creates a new exception with a meaningful error message.
      Since <code>read_grid</code> itself doesn't contain a <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> block,
      this exception will always be thrown up and out of the function,
      to be caught and handled by whoever is calling <code>read_grid</code>.
      We can define new types of exceptions if we want to.
      And we should,
      so that errors in our code can be distinguished from errors in other people's
      code.
      However,
      this involves classes and objects,
      which is outside the scope of these lessons.</p>

    <h2>Unit Testing</h2>

    <p>Most people don't enjoy writing tests,
      so if we want them to actually do it,
      it must be easy to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>add or change tests,</li>
      <li>understand the tests that have already been written,</li>
      <li>run those tests, and</li>
      <li>understand those tests' results.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Test results must also be reliable.
      If a testing tool says that code is working when it's not,
      or reports problems when there actually aren't any,
      people will lose faith in it and stop using it.</p>

    <p>The simplest kind of test is a <a href="#gloss:unit_test">unit test</a>
      that checks the behavior of one component of a program.
      As an example,
      suppose we're testing a function called <code>rectangle_area</code>
      that returns the area of an <code>(x0, y0, x1, y1)</code> rectangle.
      We'll start by testing our code directly using <code>assert</code>.
      Here,
      we call the function three times with different arguments,
      checking that the right value is returned each time.</p>

<pre><span class="in">from rectangle import rectangle_area

assert rectangle_area([0, 0, 1, 1]) == 1.0
assert rectangle_area([1, 1, 4, 4]) == 9.0
assert rectangle_area([0, 1, 4, 7]) == 24.0</span>

<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

      3 assert rectangle_area([0, 0, 1, 1]) == 1.0
      4 assert rectangle_area([1, 1, 4, 4]) == 9.0
----&gt; 5 assert rectangle_area([0, 1, 4, 7]) == 24.0

AssertionError:</span></pre>

    <p>This result is used,
      in the sense that we know something's wrong,
      but look closely at what happens if we run the tests in a different order:</p>

<pre><span class="in">assert rectangle_area([0, 1, 4, 7]) == 24.0
assert rectangle_area([1, 1, 4, 4]) == 9.0
assert rectangle_area([0, 0, 1, 1]) == 1.0</span>

<span class="err">---------------------------------------------------------------------------

----&gt; 1 assert rectangle_area([0, 1, 4, 7]) == 24.0
      2 assert rectangle_area([1, 1, 4, 4]) == 9.0
      3 assert rectangle_area([0, 0, 1, 1]) == 1.0

AssertionError:</span></pre>

    <p>Python halts at the first failed assertion,
      so the second and third tests aren't run at all.
      It would be more helpful if we could get data from all of our tests every time
      they're run,
      since the more information we have,
      the faster we're likely to be able to track down bugs.
      It would also be helpful to have some kind of summary report:
      if our <a href="#gloss:test_suite">test suite</a> includes thirty or forty tests
      (as it well might for a complex function or library that's widely used),
      we'd like to know how many passed or failed.</p>

    <p>Here's a different approach.
      First, let's put each test in a function with a meaningful name:</p>

<pre><span class="in">def test_unit_square():
    assert rectangle_area([0, 0, 1, 1]) == 1.0

def test_large_square():
    assert rectangle_area([1, 1, 4, 4]) == 9.0

def test_actual_rectangle():
    assert rectangle_area([0, 1, 4, 7]) == 24.0</span></pre>

    <p>Next,
      import a library called <code>ears</code>
      and ask it to run our tests for us:</p>

<pre><span class="in">import ears
ears.run()</span>

<span class="out">..f
2 pass, 1 fail, 0 error
----------------------------------------
fail: test_actual_rectangle
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ears.py", line 45, in run
    test()
  File "&lt;ipython-input-18-643689ad0a0f&gt;", line 8, in test_actual_rectangle
    assert rectangle_area([0, 1, 4, 7]) == 24.0
AssertionError</span></pre>

    <p><code>ears.run</code> looks in the calling program
      for functions whose names start with the letters <code>'test_'</code>
      and runs each one.
      If the function complete without an assertion being triggered,
      we count the test as a <a href="#gloss:test_success">success</a>.
      If an assertion fails,
      we count the test as a <a href="#gloss:test_failure">failure</a>,
      but if any other exception occurs,
      we count it as an <a href="#gloss:test_error">error</a>
      because the odds are that the test itself is broken.</p>

    <p><code>ears</code> is an <a href="#gloss:xUnit">xUnit testing library</a>.
      The name &quot;xUnit&quot; comes from the fact that
      many of them are imitations of a Java testing library called JUnit.
      The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks">Wikipedia
        page</a> on the
      subject
      lists dozens of similar frameworks in almost as many languages,
      all of which have a similar structure:
      each test is a single function that follows some naming convention
      (e.g., starts with <code>'test_'</code>),
      and the framework runs them in some order
      and reports how many passed, failed, or were broken.</p>

    <h2>Using a Debugger</h2>

    <p>
      Programmers spend a lot of time debugging,
      so it's worth learning how to do it systematically.
      We'll talk about tools first,
      since they'll make everything else less painful.
      We'll then talk about some techniques.
      Throughout,
      we'll assume that we built the right thing the wrong way;
      requirements errors are actually a major cause of software project failure,
      but they're out of scope for now.

      When something goes wrong in a program like this:
    </p>

<pre>import sys

def insert_or_increment(counts, species, number):
    # Look for species in list.
    for (s, n) in counts:
        # If we have seen it before, add to its count and exit.

    <p>
      most people start debugging by adding <code>print</code> statements:

    # Look for species in list.
    print 'insert_or_increment(', counts, ',', species, ',', number, ')'
    for (s, n) in counts:
        print '...checking against', s, n
        # If we have seen it before, add to its count and exit.
        if s == species:

            print '...species matched, so returning with', counts
            return
    # Haven't seen it before, so add it.
    counts.append([species, number])

    <p>
      This works for small problems&mdash;i.e.,
      it gives the programmer enough insight into the problem to fix it&mdash;but
      it doesn't scale to larger programs or harder problems.
      First,
      adding print statements is a good way to add typos,
      particularly when we have to modify the block structure of the program
      to fit them in.
      It's also time-consuming to type things,
      delete them,
      type more in,
      and so on.
      It's especially tedious if we're working in a language like C++, Fortran, or Java
      that requires compilation.
      Finally,
      if we're printing lots of information,
      it's all too easy to miss the crucial bit as it flies by on the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <a href="#gloss:debugger">debugger</a> is
      a program that controls the execution of some
      <a href="#gloss:target-program">target program</a>&mdash;typically,
      one that has a bug in it that we're trying to track down.
      Debuggers are more properly called <em>symbolic</em> debuggers
      because they show us the source code we wrote,
      rather than raw machine instructions
      (although debuggers exists to do that too).
      While the target program is running,
      the debugger can:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        pause, resume, or restart it;
      </li>
      <li>
        display or change values in it; and
      </li>
      <li>
        watch for calls to particular functions or changes to particular variables.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here's what a typical debugger looks like in action:
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: debugger screenshot</p>

    <p>
      The most important parts of this display are
      the source code window and the call stack display.
      The former shows us where we are in the program;
      the latter,
      what variables are in scope and what their values are.
      Most debuggers also display whatever the target program has printed to standard output recently.
    </p>

    <p>
      We typically start a debugging session by setting
      a <a href="#gloss:breakpoint">breakpoints</a> in the target program.
      This tells the debugger to suspend the target program whenever it reaches that line
      so that we can inspect the program's state.
      For example,
      <a href="#f:debugger_screenshot">Figure XXX</a> shows the state of the program
      when adding four herrings to the list of species' counts.
      The program is paused while it processes the first entry in the list
      to let us explore our data and call stack,
      without having to modify the code in any way.
      We can also use the debugger to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#gloss:single-step">single-step</a>,
        i.e., execute one statement at a time;
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#gloss:step-into">step into</a> function calls;
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#gloss:step-over">step over</a> them; or
      </li>
      <li>
        run to the end of the current function.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This allows us to see how values are changing,
      which branches the program is actually taking,
      which functions are actually being called,
      and most importantly,
      why.
    </p>

    <p>
      But debuggers can do much more than this.
      For example,
      most debuggers let us move up and down the call stack,
      so that when our program is halted,
      we can see the current values of variables in <em>any</em> active function call,
      not just the one we're in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most debuggers also support
      <a href="#gloss:conditional-breakpoint">conditional breakpoints</a>,
      which only takes effect if some condition is met.
      For example,
      we can set a breakpoint inside a loop so that the target program only halts
      when the loop index is greater than 100.
      This saves us having to step through 100 uninteresting iterations of the loop.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can also use the debugger to modify values while the program is running.
      For example,
      suppose we have a theory about why a bug is occurring.
      We can run the target program to that point,
      change the value of a particular variable,
      then resume the target program.
      This trick is sometimes used to test out error-handling code,
      since it's easier to change <code>time_spent_waiting</code> to 600 seconds in debugger
      than to pull out the network cable and wait ten minutes&hellip;
    </p>

    <h2>Numbers</h2>

    <p>
      Let's start by looking at how numbers are stored.
      If we only have the two digits 0 and 1,
      the natural way to store a positive integer is to use base 2,
      so 1001<sub>2</sub> is
      (1&times;2<sup>3</sup>)+(0&times;2<sup>2</sup>)+(0&times;2<sup>1</sup>)+(1&times;2<sup>0</sup>) = 9<sub>10</sub>.
      It's equally natural to extend this scheme to negative numbers by reserving one bit for the sign.
      If, for example, we use 0 for positive numbers and 1 for those that are negative,
      +9<sub>10</sub> would be 01001<sub>2</sub> and -9<sub>10</sub> would be 11001<sub>10</sub>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two problems with this.
      The first is that this scheme gives us two representations for zero (00000<sub>2</sub> and 10000<sub>2</sub>).
      This isn't necessarily fatal,
      but any claims this scheme has to being "natural" disappear when we have to write code like:
    </p>

<pre>if (length != +0) and (length != -0)</pre>

    <p>
      As for the other problem,
      it turns out that the circuits needed to do addition and other arithmetic on this
      <a href="#gloss:sign-and-magnitude">sign and magnitude representation</a>
      are more complicated than the hardware needed for another called
      <a href="#gloss:twos-complement">two's complement</a>.
      Instead of mirroring positive values,
      two's complement rolls over when going below zero,
      just like a car's odometer.
      If we're using four bits per number,
      so that 0<sub>10</sub> is 0000<sub>2</sub>,
      then -1<sub>10</sub> is 1111<sub>2</sub>.
      -2<sub>10</sub> is 1110<sub>2</sub>,
      -3<sub>10</sub> is 1101<sub>2</sub>,
      and so on until we reach the most negative number we can represent,
      1000<sub>2</sub>, which is -8.
      Our representation then wraps around again, so that 0111<sub>2</sub> is 7<sub>10</sub>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This scheme isn't intuitive,
      but it solves sign and magnitude's "double zero" problem,
      and the hardware to handle it is faster and cheaper.
      As a bonus,
      we can still tell whether a number is positive or negative by looking at the first bit:
      negative numbers have a 1, positives have a 0.
      The only odd thing is its asymmetry:
      because 0 counts as a positive number,
      numbers go from -8 to 7, or -16 to 15, and so on.
      As a result, even if <code>x</code> is a valid number, <code>-x</code> may not be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finding a good representation for real numbers
      (called <a href="##gloss:floating-point">floating point numbers</a>,
      since the decimal point can move around)
      is a much harder problem.
      The root of the problem is that
      we cannot represent an infinite number of real values with a finite set of bit patterns.
      And unlike integers,
      no matter what values we <em>do</em> represent,
      there will be an infinite number of values between each of them that we can't.
    </p>

    <p>
      Floating point numbers are usually represented using sign, magnitude, and an exponent.
      In a 32-bit word,
      the IEEE 754 standard calls for 1 bit of sign,
      23 bits for the magnitude (or <em>mantissa</em>),
      and 8 bits for the exponent.
      To illustrate the problems with floating point,
      we'll use a much dumber representation:
      we'll only worry about positive values without fractional parts,
      and we'll only use 3 for the magnitude and 2 for the exponent.
    </p>

    <p>FIXME: diagram</p>

    <p>
      The diagram above
      shows the values that we can represent this way.
      Each one is the mantissa times two to the exponent.
      For example, the decimal values 48 is binary 110 times 2 to the binary 11 power,
      which is 6 times 2 to the third,
      or 6 times 8.
      (Note that real floating point representations like the IEEE 754 standard
      don't have the redundancy shown in this table,
      but that doesn't affect our argument.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing you should notice is that there are a lot of values we <em>can't</em> store.
      We can do 8 and 10, for example, but not 9.
      This is exactly like the problems hand calculators have with fractions like 1/3:
      in decimal, we have to round that to 0.3333 or 0.3334.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if this scheme has no representation for 9,
      then 8+1 must be stored as either 8 or 10.
      This raises an interesting question:
      if 8+1 is 8, what is 8+1+1?
      If we add from the left, 8+1 is 8, plus another 1 is 8 again.
      If we add from the right, though, 1+1 is 2, and 2+8 is 10.
      Changing the order of operations can make the difference between right and wrong.
      There's no randomness involved&mdash;a particular order of operations
      will always produce the same result&mdash;but
      as the number of steps increases,
      so too does the difficulty of figuring out what the best order is.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the sort of problem that numerical analysts spend their time on.
      In this case, if we sort the values we're adding, then add from smallest to largest,
      it gives us a better chance of getting the best possible answer.
      In other situations,
      like inverting a matrix,
      the rules are much more complicated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's another observation about our uneven number line:
      the spacing between the values we can represent is uneven,
      but the relative spacing between each set of values stays the same,
      i.e., the first group is separated by 1, then the separation becomes 2, then 4, then 8,
      so that the ratio of the spacing to the values stays roughly constant.
      This happens because we're multiplying the same fixed set of mantissas by ever-larger exponents,
      and it points us at a couple of useful definitions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="#gloss:absolute-error">absolute error</a> in some approximation
      is simply the absolute value of the difference between the actual value and the approximation.
      The <a href="#gloss:relative-error">relative error</a>,
      on the other hand,
      is the ratio of the absolute error to the value we're approximating.
      For example, if we're off by 1 in approximating 8+1 and 56+1,
      the absolute error is the same in both cases,
      but the relative error in the first case is 1/9 = 11%,
      while the relative error in the second case is only 1/57 = 1.7%.
      When we're thinking about floating point numbers,
      relative error is almost always more useful than absolute error.
      After all,
      it makes little sense to say that we're off by a hundredth when the value in question is a billionth.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see why this matters, let's have a look at a little program:
    </p>

<pre>nines = []
sums = []
current = 0.0
for i in range(1, 10):
    num = 9.0 / (10.0 ** i)
    nines.append(num)
    current += num
    sums.append(current)
for i in range(len(nines)):
    print '%.18f %.18f' % (nines[i], sums[i])
</pre>

    <p>
      The loop runs over the integers from 1 to 9 inclusive.
      Using those values, we create the numbers 0.9, 0.09, 0.009, and so on, and put them in the list <code>vals</code>.
      We then calculate the sum of those numbers.
      Clearly, this should be 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, and so on.
      But is it?
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>0.900000000000000022</td><td>0.900000000000000022</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>0.089999999999999997</td><td>0.989999999999999991</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3</td><td>0.008999999999999999</td><td>0.998999999999999999</td></tr>
      <tr><td>4</td><td>0.000900000000000000</td><td>0.999900000000000011</td></tr>
      <tr><td>5</td><td>0.000090000000000000</td><td>0.999990000000000046</td></tr>
      <tr><td>6</td><td>0.000009000000000000</td><td>0.999999000000000082</td></tr>
      <tr><td>7</td><td>0.000000900000000000</td><td>0.999999900000000053</td></tr>
      <tr><td>8</td><td>0.000000090000000000</td><td>0.999999990000000061</td></tr>
      <tr><td>9</td><td>0.000000009000000000</td><td>0.999999999000000028</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Here are our answers.
      The first column is the loop index;
      the second, what we actually got when we tried to calculate 0.9, 0.09, and so on,
      and the third is the cumulative sum.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing you should notice is that the very first value contributing to our sum is already slightly off.
      Even with 23 bits for a mantissa,
      we cannot exactly represent 0.9 in base 2,
      any more than we can exactly represent 1/3 in base 10.
      Doubling the size of the mantissa would reduce the error,
      but we can't ever eliminate it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second thing to notice is that our approximation to 0.0009 actually appears accurate,
      as do all of the approximations after that.
      This may be misleading, though:
      after all,
      we've only printed things out to 18 decimal places.
      As for the errors in the last few digits of the sums,
      there doesn't appear to be any regular pattern in the way they increase and decrease.
    </p>

    <p>
      This phenomenon is one of the things that makes testing scientific programs hard.
      If a function uses floating point numbers,
      what do we compare its result to
      if we want to check that it's working correctly?
      If we compared the sum of the first few numbers in <code>vals</code> to what it's supposed to be,
      the answer could be <code>False</code>,
      even if we're initializing the list with the right values,
      and calculating the sum correctly.
      This is a genuinely hard problem,
      and no one has a good generic answer.
      The root of our problem is that we're using approximations,
      and each approximation has to be judged on its own merits.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are things you can do, though.
      The first rule is,
      compare what you get to analytic solutions whenever you can.
      For example,
      if you're looking at the behavior of drops of liquid helium,
      start by checking your program's output on a stationary spherical drop in zero gravity.
      You should be able to calculate the right answer in that case,
      and if your program doesn't work for it,
      it probably won't work for anything else.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second rule is to compare more complex versions of your code to simpler ones.
      If you're about to replace a simple algorithm for calculating heat transfer with one that's more complex,
      but hopefully faster,
      don't throw the old code away.
      Instead,
      use its output as a check on the correctness of the new code.
      And if you bump into someone at a conference who has a program that can calculate some of the same results as yours,
      swap data sets:
      it'll help you both.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third rule is, never use <code>==</code> (or <code>!=</code>) on floating point numbers,
      because two numbers calculated in different ways will probably not have exactly the same bits.
      Instead,
      check to see whether two values are within some tolerance,
      and if they are,
      treat them as equal.
      Doing this forces you to make your tolerances explicit,
      which is useful in its own right
      (just as putting error bars on experimental results is useful).
    </p>

    <h2>The Really Important Stuff</h2>

    <p>
      In my experience, the things that go wrong most often in software
      development projects&mdash;undergraduate or professional&mdash;have nothing to
      do with software.  Instead, the worst mistakes people make are all
      related to the human side of things.  Since some of you will only read
      the first few pages of any document, I have put the three most
      important topics here in a chapter of their own.
    </p>

    <h3>Meetings</h3>

    <p>
      I have a theory.  It's not about why there are no toilets on the
      <em>Enterprise</em> (hint: transporters).  It's about why bad
      software exists.
    </p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>
	Fact #1: the two biggest reasons software projects blow up are poor
	requirements management and integration failure: either the wrong
	thing is built, or the pieces don't work together when they're
	assembled.
      </p>

      <p>
	Fact #2: the usual way to sort out requirements and negotiate
	interfaces is face-to-face discussion.  That means having meetings.
      </p>

      <p>
	Fact #3: most people are really bad at meetings: they don't have an
	agenda going in, they don't take minutes, they waffle on or wander
	off into irrelevancies, they repeat what others have said or recite
	banalities simply so that they'll have said something, they hold
	side conversations (which pretty much guarantees that the meeting
	will be a waste of time), and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
	Conclusion: people create bad software because they're bad at
	meetings.
      </p>

      <p>
	Corollary: improve people's meeting skills, and you'll improve the
	software they produce.
      </p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      So, here's how to run a meeting.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <em>Start with an agenda.</em> If nobody cares enough about the meeting
      to write a point-form list of what's supposed to be discussed, the
      meeting itself probably doesn't need to happen.  Agendas also help you
      keep the meeting moving (as in, "That's very interesting, Yousuf, but
      we have five other topics to get through in the next fifteen minutes,
      so could you please make your point?").
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Only one person talks at a time.</em>  That means no side
      conversations, no catching up with blogs, and no cell phones or
      Blackberries.  This rule is important because:
    </p>

    <ol>

      <li>It's more efficient.  Nobody can actually pay attention to two
	things at once: if distractions are tolerated, people will miss
	things, or they'll have to be repeated, or both.</li>

      <li>Not paying attention is insulting&mdash;chatting with a friend on
	IM while someone explains what they did last week is a really
	effective way to say, "I don't think your work is important."</li>

    </ol>

    <p>
      <em>Put someone in charge of the meeting.</em> "In charge" means
      keeping the meeting moving, glaring at people who are muttering to one
      another or checking email, and telling people who are talking too much
      to get to the point.  It does <em>not</em> mean doing all the talking;
      in fact, whoever is in charge will usually talk less than anyone else,
      just as a referee usually kicks the ball less often than the players.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>No one is allowed to interrupt</em> (except the person in charge).
      Raise a finger (no, not that one), or make one of the other gestures
      people make at high-priced auctions instead if you want to speak next.
      If the speaker doesn't notice you, the person in charge ought to.  Oh,
      and while other people are talking, take notes of questions you want
      to ask or points you want to make.  You'll be surprised how smart it
      makes you look when it <em>is</em> your turn to speak.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Have one person take minutes,</em> and circulate them (by email, or
      in a blog or a wiki) by the end of the day of the meeting.  These
      minutes aren't supposed to be a word-for-word record of who said what.
      Instead, they should summarize the main points people made, the
      questions that no one could answer, and the things people promised to
      do, so that:
    </p>

    <ol>

      <li><em>People who weren't at the meeting can keep track of
	  what's going on.</em>  You and your fellow students all have to juggle
	assignments from several other courses while doing this project,
	which means that sometimes you won't be able to make it to team
	meetings.  A wiki page, email message, or blog entry is a much more
	efficient way to catch up after a missed meeting or two than asking
	a team mate, "Hey, what did I miss?"</li>

      <li><em>Everyone can check what was actually said or promised.</em>
	More than once, I've looked over the minutes of a meeting I was in
	and thought, "Did I say that?" or, "Wait a minute, I didn't
	promise to have it ready then!"  Accidentally or not, people will
	often remember things differently; writing it down gives team
	members a chance to correct mistaken or malicious interpretations,
	which can save a lot of anguish later on.</li>

      <li><em>People can be held accountable at subsequent meetings.</em>
	There's no point making lists of questions and
	action items if you don't follow up on them later.  If you're
	using a ticketing system, the best thing to do is to create a
	ticket for each new question or task right after the meeting,
	and update those that are being carried forward.  That way,
	your agenda for the next meeting can start by rattling through
	a list of tickets.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>
      That's it.  Run all your meetings like this for a month, with the goal
      of making each one a minute shorter than the one before, and I promise
      that you'll build better software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, wait, there's one more rule: don't meet just to exchange
      information.  Once you're using version control and tickets
      you'll be able to keep track of your teammates' actual progress
      via the web.  Meetings should be held to make decisions about
      design, work allocation, and what to cut when time gets tight.
      Remember, you can read faster than anyone can speak: if someone
      has facts for the rest of the team to absorb, the most polite
      way to communicate them is to type them in.
    </p>

    <h3>Crunch Mode</h3>

    <p>
      I used to brag about the hours I was working.  Not in so many words,
      of course&mdash;I had <em>some</em> social skills.  Instead, I'd show up for
      class around noon, unshaven and yawning, and casually mention how I'd
      been up 'til 6:00 a.m. hacking away at some monster bug or other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back, I can't remember who I was trying to impress.  Instead,
      what I remember is how much of the code I wrote in those all-nighters
      I threw away once I'd had some sleep, and how much damage the bugs I
      created in those bleary-eyed stupors did to my grades.
    </p>

    <p>
      My mistake was to confuse "working" with "being productive".  You
      can't produce software (or anything else) without doing some work, but
      you can easily do lots of work without producing anything of value.
      Scientific study of the issue goes back to at least the 1890s.  The most important results for students are:
    </p>

    <ol>

      <li>Working more than eight hours a day for an extended period of
	time lowers your total productivity, not just your hourly
	productivity&mdash;i.e., you get less done in total (not just per hour)
	when you're in crunch mode than you do when you work regular hours.</li>

      <li>Working over 21 hours in a stretch increases the odds of you
	making a catastrophic error just as much as being legally drunk.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>
      These facts have been reproduced and verified through hundreds of
      experiments over the course of more than a century.  The data behind
      them is as solid as the data linking smoking to lung cancer.  However,
      while most smokers will admit that their habit is killing them, people
      in the software industry still talk and act as if they were somehow
      exempt from these findings.  To quote Robinson's article:
    </p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>
	When Henry Ford famously adopted a 40-hour workweek in 1926, he was
	bitterly criticized by members of the National Association of
	Manufacturers. But his experiments, which he'd been conducting for
	at least 12 years, showed him clearly that cutting the workday from
	ten hours to eight hours&mdash;and the workweek from six days to five
	days&mdash;increased total worker output and reduced production
	cost... the core of his argument was that reduced shift length
	meant more output.
      </p>

      <p>
	...many studies, conducted by businesses, universities,
	industry associations and the military, ...support the basic
	notion that, for most people, eight hours a day, five days per week,
	is the best sustainable long-term balance point between output and
	exhaustion. Throughout the 30s, 40s, and 50s, these studies were
	apparently conducted by the hundreds; and by the 1960s, the benefits
	of the 40-hour week were accepted almost beyond question in
	corporate America. In 1962, the Chamber of Commerce even published a
	pamphlet extolling the productivity gains of reduced hours.
      </p>

      <p>
	But, somehow, Silicon Valley didn't get the memo...
      </p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I was part of a data visualization startup in the mid-1990s.  Three
      months before our first release, the head of development "asked" us to
      start coming in on Saturdays.  We were already pulling one late night
      a week at that point<sup><a href="#n:crunch-1">1</a></sup>, and most
      of us were also working at least a couple of hours at home in the
      evenings.  It's hardly surprising that we missed our "can't miss"
      deadline by ten weeks, and had to follow up our 1.0 release with a
      1.1, and then a 1.2, in order to patch the crash-and-lose-data bugs
      we'd created.  We were all zombies, and zombies can't code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those kinds of hours are sadly still normal in many parts of the
      software industry, and also in university programs.  Everyone knows
      that designing and building software is a creative act that requires a
      clear head, but many of those same people then act as if it was like
      digging a ditch.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big difference is that it's hard to lose ground when digging
      (though not impossible).  In software, on the other hand, it's very
      easy to go backward.  It only takes me a couple of minutes to
      create a bug that will take hours to track down later&mdash;or days, if
      someone else is unlucky enough to have to track it down.  This is
      summarized in Robinson's first rule:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Productivity varies over the course of the workday, with the
      greatest productivity occurring in the first four to six
      hours. After enough hours, productivity approaches zero; eventually
      it becomes negative.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      It's hard to quantify the productivity of programmers, testers, and
      UI designers, but five eight-hour days per week has been proven to
      maximize long-term total output in every industry that has ever been
      studied.  There's no reason to believe that software development is
      any different, or that student programming is different from full-time
      programming in industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ah, you say, that's "long-term total output".  What about short
      bursts now and then, like pulling an all-nighter to meet a deadline?
      Well, that's been studied too, and the results aren't pleasant.  Your
      ability to think drops by 25% for each 24 hours you're awake.  Put it
      another way, the average person's IQ is only 75 after one all-nighter,
      which puts them in the bottom 5% of the population.  Two all nighters
      in a row, and their effective IQ is 50, the level at which people are
      usually judged incapable of independent living.
    </p>

    <p>
      The catch in all of this is that <em>people usually don't notice
	their abilities declining</em>.  Just like drunks who think they're still
      able to drive, people who are deprived of sleep don't realize that
      they're not finishing their sentences (or thoughts).  They certainly
      don't realize that they're passing parameters into function calls the
      wrong way around, or that what they're typing in will all have to be
      deleted and re-done tomorrow, when it will take longer than it would
      have if they'd just gone home and gotten a good night's sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moral of this story?  Think very hard about what's more important
      to you: the amount of good work you produce, or how much of a martyr
      you appear to be.  Then think about which of those other people are
      actually going to care about, and pace yourself accordingly.
    </p>

    <h3>Time Management</h3>

    <p>
      "But&mdash;but&mdash;I have so many assignments to do!", you say.  "And
      they're all due at once!  I <em>have</em> to work extra hours to get
      them all done!"
    </p>

    <p>
      No.  You can work <em>smarter</em> instead.  I'm less intelligent than
      many of the people I've worked with over the years.  I still manage to
      get a lot done because I learned early on that organization and focus
      are more important than raw IQ.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to be productive, you have to do two things: prioritize, and
      focus.  The first is important because people are naturally very good
      at spending hours on things that don't need to be done, and then
      finding themselves with too little time for the things that actually
      count.  It can actually be expressed as an algorithm:
    </p>

    <ol>

      <li>Make a list of the things you have to do.  I still use a
	hardcover lab notebook for this, since I can doodle in it when
	I'm on the subway, but a lot of people keep a personal wiki,
	or send themselves email messages that then go into a folder
	titled "To Do".  However you do it, the important thing is
	to <em>write it all down</em>.  Your mind can only keep seven
	or so things in your short-term memory at once; if you try to
	manage a to-do list longer than that in your head, you will
	forget things.</li>

      <li>Weed out everything that you don't need to do right away.
	Notice that I said "need", not "want": if you want to mess
	around with a new blogging tool, that's fine, but that's play time,
	not work time, and we're talking about getting work done.</li>

      <li>Prioritize what's left by sorting the list so that the most
	important tasks are at the top.  (I don't worry about getting the
	stuff below the first three or four lines into exact order, since
	I'm going to re-check my list before I get to them anyway.)</li>

      <li>Make sure you have everything you need to see the first task
	through: files from version control, the assignment
	specification, whatever libraries and documentation you need,
	a fresh cup of coffee, a comfortable chair, etc.  Don't give
	yourself an excuse to interrupt your own work: the world will
	provide enough of those.</li>

      <li>Shut down your mail client, and turn off instant messaging and
	your cell phone.  Don't panic, it's only for an hour&mdash;most people
	can't stay focused longer than that, and anyway, you'll need to
	stretch your muscles and get rid of that coffee you drank.</li>

      <li>Set an alarm to go off in sixty minutes, and <em>focus</em>.
	Don't switch tasks in that hour unless you absolutely have to.
	Instead, if you remember an email message that needs to be sent, or
	discover a couple of tests that really should be written, add a note
	to your to-do list.  (This is another reason I keep mine in a lab
	notebook: the few seconds it takes to pick up a pen and jot
	something down gives my hands a rest from the keyboard.)</li>

      <li>When your hour is up, take a break: check mail (but don't
	reply to anything that isn't urgent), go to the washroom, stretch a
	little, and then re-order your to-do list and start the next round.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>
      If any task on your list is more than an hour long, break it down into
      into smaller pieces and prioritize those separately.  Keep in mind
      that the future is approaching at a fixed rate of one day every 24
      hours: if something's going to take sixty hours to do, you'd better
      allow at least ten working days for it, which means you'd better tackle the
      first piece two working weeks before the deadline.  And since breaking
      large tasks down into small ones takes time, don't be surprised if
      "plan XYZ" appears as a task in your list.
    </p>

    <p>
      The point of all this organization and preparation is to get
      yourself into the most productive mental state possible.
      Psychologists call it flow; athletes call it "being in the
      zone", while musicians talk about losing themselves in what
      they're playing.  Whatever name you use, you will produce much
      more per unit of time in this state than normal.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's the good news.  The bad news is that it takes roughly ten
      minutes to get back into a state of flow after an interruption, no
      matter how short the interruption was.  This means that if you are
      interrupted half a dozen times per hour, you are <em>never</em> at
      your productive peak.  It's very much like processes being paged in
      and out by an operating system: if it happens too often, the CPU
      spends all its time moving things around, and none doing useful
      work.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a concrete example, a student of mine kept a stopwatch beside his
      computer for a couple of weeks during term.  Every time he read mail,
      put his instant messaging client in the foreground, or went to
      Manchester United's web site, he hit the button to stop it.  At the
      end of two weeks, he discovered that he only spent 28% of his
      "working" time working.  Put it another way, he could have finished
      his assignments in a third of the time they actually took.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to get as much work done as possible, so that you will
      have enough time for other things, it is therefore crucial that you
      separate the two.  IM and your cell phone are great for socializing;
      it's easy to tell yourself that you should leave them on so that your
      teammates can reach you, but it just ain't true.  The best way to help
      your teammates is to get your part of the project done; the best way
      to show your significant other that you really love them is to finish
      your assignments as quickly as you can so that you can go out and see
      the latest Pixar movie without having to cut out and go back to the
      lab.
    </p>

    <p>
      Making lists and setting one-hour alarms will probably seem a little
      earnest at first.  Trust me, though: your friends will stop mocking
      you once they see that you're able to finish your assignments and
      still have time to play some badminton and catch a movie.  They may
      even start to imitate you.
    </p>

    <h2>Are You Sitting Comfortably?</h2>

    <p>
      A complete working environment needs more than just software.
      Unfortunately, most university labs seemed designed to make everything
      below difficult or impossible to achieve.
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li><em>Peace and quiet.</em> Study after study has proved that this
	has more impact on productivity than a fast network, a fat disk, or
	caffeine, but most workplaces are still too crowded, too noisy, and
	filled with too many interrupts.  As mentioned above, it takes most people ten minutes to get
	back into a state of flow after being distracted, which means that
	half a dozen interruptions per hour effectively renders someone zero
	percent effective.  I know people say, "If I can't overhear what
	other people are talking about, I might miss something important,"
	but that only applies if the only people you're overhearing are
	members of your own team (and even then, it's a dubious claim).</li>

      <li><em>Comfortable seating.</em> A good chair with a firm back
	costs one fifth of what a mid-range PC does.  A full-sized keyboard
	(I have large hands&mdash;most laptop keyboards force me to bend my
	wrists uncomfortably) costs fifty dollars, and a lamp with a
	soft-light bulb is another forty.  The combination doesn't just let
	me program longer each day; it also helps ensure that I'll still be
	able to program five or ten years from now without chronic back and
	wrist pain.  Compare this with what's in most computer labs: their
	lighting gives glare without illumination, the dark desktops make
	the optical mice jerky, and the low-budget chairs are guaranteed to
	make your lower back ache after an hour.</li>

      <li><em>A pad of gridded paper and several ballpoint pens.</em>  I
	often make notes for myself when programming, or draw box-and-arrow
	diagrams of my data structures when debugging.  I used to keep an
	editor open in a background window to do the former, but when my
	wrists started acting up, I discovered that taking my hands away
	from the keyboard for a few moments to scribble something down
	provided welcome relief.  I also quickly discovered that the odds of
	me being able to read my own notes the next day rose dramatically if
	I used gridded paper to line them up.</li>

      <li><em>A heavy mug for coffee or tea.</em> I don't know why, but a
	styrofoam cup, or a normal teacup, just isn't as satisfying as a
	little hand-sized ceramic boulder.  Maybe it satisfies my
	subconscious Neanderthal urge to club my computer to death when it
	misbehaves...</li>

      <li><em>A rubber duck.</em> One of computing's many apocryphal
	stories holds that someone&mdash;Brian Kernighan, maybe, or Dennis
	Ritchie&mdash;keeps a rubber duck next to his computer.  Whenever a bug
	takes more than a few minutes to track down, he puts the duck on his
	desk and explains the problem to it.  Why?  Because speaking out
	loud forces you to marshal your thoughts, which in turn highlights
	any contradictions or missed steps that you hadn't noticed while
	everything was just swirling around inside your head.</li>

      <li><em>A squirt bottle of glass cleaner and a box of kleenex.</em>
	I can't stand smears on my screen.  They drive me nuts.  Whenever
	I'm showing something to someone, and they actually <em>touch my
	  screen</em> instead of just pointing, I have another Neanderthal
	fantasy, except this time it's not subconscious...</li>

      <li><em>A chess set</em>, or a deck of cards, or some juggling
	balls.  I'm a very bad chess player.  Luckily, so are most
	people, so it's usually possible to find someone at my level
	for a ten-minute game at lunch.  Other programmers I know play
	euchre, or knit&mdash;a programmers' stitch 'n' bitch session
	can be jaw-dropping to listen to.  Few people can focus for
	more than a few hours before their productivity drops; it's
	better to acknowledge this, and take a break in the middle of
	the day, than to say, "Must... keep... coding..." and produce
	garbage that just has to be rewritten later.</li>

      <li><em>Books.</em> You can find a lot on-line, but it's hard to
	google with your feet up on your desk, and even harder to fold down
	the corners on web pages.  When I want API documentation, I use the
	web; when I want a tutorial, I still prefer the printed page.</li>

      <li><em>Running shoes.</em> Back when I was a part-time grad
	student, I had a settled routine: I brought three sets of gym gear
	to the office at the start of the week, worked out at lunchtime on
	Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and took my stuff home at the end of
	the week.  After two months of this, I came in to find that my
	co-workers had hung a little chandelier made of air fresheners over
	my desk.  Since then, I've rented a locker at the gym, but I still
	try to get some exercise several times a week&mdash;it helps my
	concentration and stamina a lot more than any amount of coffee..</li>

      <li><em>Pictures.</em> Ah, the nesting instinct.  Everyone wants to
	feel at home; everyone wants to make wherever they are uniquely
	theirs.  I hang a few postcards on the wall wherever I work, along
	with a photograph of my wife and daughter taken ten hours after she
	was born (my daughter, that is), just to remind me what's really
	important.</li>

    </ul>

    <h1 id="s:why">Why I Teach</h1>

    <p>
      When I was your age, I thought universities existed to teach people
      how to learn.  Later, when I was in grad school, I thought
      universities were about doing research and creating new knowledge. Now
      that I'm in my forties, though, I've realized that what we're really
      doing here is teaching you how to take over the world&mdash;because
      whether you like it or not, you're going to have to one day.
    </p>

    <p>
      My parents are in their seventies, and retired.  Their generation
      doesn't run the world any more; instead, it's people my age, or a bit
      older, who pass laws, decide whether interest rates will go up or
      down, and make life-and-death decisions in hospitals.  As scary as it
      seems, <em>we</em> are now the grownups.
    </p>

    <p>
      Twenty years from now, though, we'll be heading for retirement, and
      <em>you</em> will be in charge, because there won't be anyone else to do
      it.  That may sound like a long time when you're nineteen, but let me
      tell you, you take three breaths, and it's gone.  That's why we give
      you problems whose answers can't be cribbed from last year's notes.
      That's why we put you in situations where you have to figure out what
      needs to be done right now, what can be left for later, and what you
      can simply ignore.  It's because if you don't start learning how to do
      these things now, you won't be ready to do them on your own when you
      have to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stirring stuff, isn't it? But it's not the whole answer.  I don't just
      want my students to make the world a better place so that I can retire
      in comfort.  I want them to make it a better place for everyone,
      because I think that's the great adventure of our times. Forget about
      landing on the moon and unraveling the genetic code: when future
      historians write about our era, what they'll focus on is that for the
      first time in history, our species started taking the Golden Rule
      seriously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just think: a hundred and fifty years ago, most societies still
      practiced slavery.  A hundred years ago, when my grandmother was a
      young girl, she wasn't legally a person in Canada.  Fifty years ago,
      most of the world's people suffered under totalitarian rule; in the
      year I was born, African-Americans couldn't vote in Southern states,
      and judges could&mdash;and did&mdash;order electroshock therapy to "cure"
      homosexuals. Yes, there's still a lot wrong with the world, but look
      at how many more choices you have than your grandparents did.  Look at
      how many more things you can know, and be, and enjoy.  And most
      importantly, look at how many other people can too.
    </p>

    <p>
      This didn't happen by chance.  It happened because millions of us made
      millions of little decisions, the sum of which was a better world.
      For the most part, we don't think of these day-to-day decisions as
      being political, but they are.  Every time we buy one brand of running
      shoe instead of another, every time we choose to take this class
      instead of that one, every time we <em>don't</em> give the homeless guy
      on the corner fifty cents, every time we decide to shout an anatomical
      insult instead of a racial one at a cabbie who shouldn't be allowed to
      drive a shopping cart, we're putting our weight behind one vision of
      what the world should be rather than another.  We don't think about
      this bigger picture most of the time&mdash;we'd be paralyzed if we did.
      But the last century and a half shows that once enough people make
      "doing the right thing" a habit, the big picture more or less takes
      care of itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      In his 1947 essay "Why I Write", George Orwell said:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive
      books, and might have remained almost unaware of my political
      loyalties.  As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of
      pamphleteer... Every line of serious work that I have written
      since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against
      totalitarianism... It seems to me nonsense, in a period like
      our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects.
      Everyone writes of them in one guise or another. It is simply a
      question of which side one takes and what approach one follows.

      Replace "writing" with "teaching", and you'll have the real
      reason I'm taking on twenty students next term.  Every line of
      code you write changes the world in some small way.  Every
      deadline you meet, every security hole you don't plug, every
      user need you satisfy, every disability you don't
      accommodate&mdash;each one makes tomorrow different from today.

      I teach because I want you to be aware of that.  I want you to be
      conscious of the fact that you're shaping the future we're all going
      to spend the rest of our lives in.  I want you to do things right, and
      to believe that doing things right is important, because the world
      doesn't get better by chance, or on its own.  The world gets better
      because people like you make it better: penny by penny, brick by
      brick, vote by vote, and one line of code at a time.
